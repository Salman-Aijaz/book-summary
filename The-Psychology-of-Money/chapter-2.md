## **Luck & Risk**

## 🔹 Summary (English)

This chapter explains that luck and risk are two sides of the same coin. Every outcome in life is influenced not only by effort and skill, but also by forces outside our control.

The story of Bill Gates shows how luck can shape success. Gates attended one of the very few schools in the world that had a computer in the late 1960s, giving him a massive head start. Gates himself admits that without this opportunity, Microsoft might never have existed. His intelligence and hard work mattered—but luck played a crucial role.

At the same time, the story of Gates’ close friend Kent Evans shows the other side: risk. Evans was equally talented and ambitious but died in a mountaineering accident before he could realize his potential. The same odds that gave Gates extraordinary luck gave Evans devastating misfortune.

The chapter argues that we often exaggerate skill when judging success and exaggerate mistakes when judging failure. Successful people are praised for bold decisions, while unlucky people are blamed for poor judgment—even when both took similar risks.

History is full of examples where bold actions look like genius only because they worked. If the outcome had been different, the same actions would be called reckless or criminal. This makes learning simple lessons from success stories very dangerous.

Because luck and risk are hard to measure and uncomfortable to acknowledge, people tend to ignore them. But doing so leads to false confidence in success and unnecessary self-blame in failure.

**Key lesson:**

Be humble when things go well, forgiving when things go wrong, and cautious about idolizing or judging others. Focus on broad patterns, not extreme success stories, because extreme outcomes are often driven heavily by luck or risk.

## 🔹 Summary (Roman Urdu)

Is chapter ka central idea yeh hai ke luck aur risk aik hi sikke ke do rukh hain. Zindagi ke results sirf mehnat aur aqal ka nateeja nahi hotay, balkay bohat se aise factors bhi hotay hain jo hamare control se bahar hotay hain.

Bill Gates ki kahani yeh dikhati hai ke luck ne uski success mein kitna bara role play kiya. 1960s mein uska aise school mein hona jahan computer maujood tha, aik one-in-a-million moka tha. Gates khud maanta hai ke agar Lakeside School na hota to Microsoft shayad exist hi na karta. Mehnat aur talent zaroori thay, lekin luck decisive tha.

Isi ke baraks, Gates ke dost Kent Evans ki kahani risk ko dikhati hai. Woh bhi utna hi talented aur ambitious tha, lekin aik mountaineering accident mein uski death ho gayi. Luck aur risk dono aik hi power hain—bas direction mukhtalif hoti hai.

Hum aksar success ko sirf skill se jor dete hain aur failure ko sirf ghalat decisions se. Jabke haqeeqat yeh hai ke bohat si kamyabiyaan luck ki wajah se hoti hain aur bohat si nakaamiyan sirf bad luck ka result hoti hain.

History mein bohat se log “genius” is liye lagtay hain kyunke unka risk kaamyaab ho gaya. Agar outcome ulta hota, to wahi actions “bewaqoofi” ya “crime” kehlatay.

Is liye sirf success stories se seekhna dangerous hai. Extreme examples mein luck aur risk ka role itna zyada hota hai ke unki lessons aam zindagi par apply nahi hoti.

**Main lesson:**

Success mein humble raho, failure par apne aap ko maaf karo, aur logon ko judge karte waqt ehtiyaat rakho. Individual heroes ke bajaye broad patterns ko dekho.
