## **Man in the Car Paradox**
## 🔹 Summary (English)

This passage explains that what people truly value in life is **not money or luxury**, but meaningful relationships, purpose, and time with loved ones—especially children. Elderly people consistently say that happiness comes from quality friendships, being part of something bigger than oneself, and spending unstructured time with family.

The author warns that people often chase expensive items—cars, watches, big houses—thinking these will earn them respect and admiration. In reality, admiration is usually directed at the **object**, not the person who owns it. People may admire a Ferrari, but they rarely care about or remember the driver.

True respect does not come from displaying wealth. Qualities like **humility, kindness, and empathy** earn far more admiration than luxury possessions ever will. The key lesson is to be mindful of why you seek wealth and how you use it.
👉 **Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays; chasing admiration through possessions is one of the lowest.**

## 🔹 Summary (Roman Urdu)

Is passage mein bataya gaya hai ke log asal mein **paisay ya luxury cheezon** ko value nahi karte, balkay **achi dosti, purpose, aur apne bachon ke sath quality time** ko sab se zyada ahmiyat dete hain. Budhay log clear kehte hain ke bachay aap ke paisay nahi chahte—wo **aap ka waqt** chahte hain.

Author kehta hai ke log mehngi gaari, ghari ya bara ghar is liye chahte hain ke unhein respect aur admiration mile. Lekin asal mein log **cheezein admire karte hain, insan ko nahi**. Ferrari dekh kar log car ko dekhte hain, driver ko yaad bhi nahi rakhte.

Real respect paisay se nahi aata. **Humility, kindness aur empathy** zyada izzat dilati hain, horsepower ya luxury nahi.
👉 Lesson ye hai ke paisay ka best use **time aur freedom** khareedna hai, na ke logon ko impress karna.
