## **Tails,You Win**

## 🔹 Summary (English)

This chapter explains that a small number of extreme outcomes (“tails”) drive most success in life, business, and investing.

## Core Idea: Tails drive everything

In many fields, most efforts fail or deliver average results. But a tiny fraction of outcomes produce nearly all the success. Understanding this changes how we judge failure, risk, and patience.

## Art & Investing Analogy

Heinz Berggruen became one of the greatest art collectors ever, not by perfectly picking masterpieces, but by buying huge quantities of art and holding them for decades.
Most of what he bought was worth little—but a small fraction (Picasso, Matisse) created enormous value.

This is how index investing works:

- Buy broadly

- Expect many failures

- Let a few winners dominate returns

You can be wrong most of the time and still succeed massively.

## Walt Disney Example

Disney produced 400+ cartoons, most of which lost money.
But Snow White (1937) changed everything:

- Earned $8 million in 6 months

- Paid off all debts

- Built Disney Studios

- Created a legacy

In business terms, 83 minutes of film mattered more than hundreds of hours before it.

## Venture Capital & Stock Market Data

From 21,000 venture investments (2004–2014):

- 65% lost money

- 1% made over 20×

- 0.5% (≈100 companies) produced most returns

Surprisingly, the public stock market works the same way.

**Russell 3000 Index (since 1980):**

- 40% of companies lost 70%+ and never recovered

- Only 7% of companies generated nearly all market returns

- Yet the index grew 73× overall

Most companies fail. A few winners carry everything.

## **Behavior Matters More Than Intelligence**

Success is not about being right all the time—it’s about not panicking during rare, critical moments.

**Investor example (1900–2019):**

- Sue: invested every month → $435,551

- Jim: sold during recessions → $257,386

- Tom: delayed reactions → $234,476

Just staying calm during 22% recession months made Sue vastly richer.

**Real Meaning of Genius**

Investing genius =
“Doing the average thing when everyone else is losing their mind.”

- Buffett made most money from 10 investments out of 400–500

- Peter Lynch: even great investors are right 6 out of 10 times

- George Soros: what matters is how much you gain when right vs lose when wrong

### **Final Message**

- Failure is normal

- Being wrong often is normal

- Big success comes from a few rare wins

- Survival + patience lets tails work in your favor

The fact that you are alive, reading this book, is itself a cosmic tail event.

## 🔹 Summary (Roman Urdu)

Is chapter ka central idea yeh hai ke zindagi, business aur investing mein aksar thori si cheezen (tails) hi tamam success create karti hain.

## Core Concept: Tails drive everything

Zyada tar koshishein fail hoti hain ya average rehti hain. Lekin bohat hi kam outcomes aise hotay hain jo poori game change kar dete hain.

## Art Example

Heinz Berggruen ne perfect art choose nahi ki.

Usne:
  - Bohat zyada art khareeda
  - Saalon tak hold kiya

99% art average nikli, lekin 1% (Picasso, Matisse) ne billion-dollar value create ki.
Yani aap zyada dafa ghalat ho kar bhi bohat sahi nateeja hasil kar sakte ho.

**Walt Disney**

Disney ne 400+ cartoons banaye, zyada tar loss mein gaye.
Lekin Snow White (1937):

- Company ko bachaya

- Qarze utaare

- Disney empire ki bunyaad rakhi

Business mein sirf 1 hit kaafi hota hai.

**Investing Facts**

**Venture Capital:**

- 65% startups fail

- Sirf 1–2% mega success

- Wohi poori industry ka return banate hain

**Stock Market (Russell 3000):**

- 40% companies kabhi recover nahi kartin

- Sirf 7% companies poora market utha leti hain

- Phir bhi market 73x grow karti hai

**Behavior > Intelligence**

Asal farq panic na karne se parta hai.

1900–2019 example:

- Sue (consistent investor): $435k

- Jim (recession mein sell): $257k

- Tom (late reactions): $234k

Sirf recessions mein sabr rakhna zindagi bhar ka result badal deta hai.

**Genius ki Definition**

Investing genius =
jab sab log panic mein hon, tab normal rehna

- Buffett ne 400–500 investments ki, paisa sirf 10 se bana

- Peter Lynch: best investor bhi sirf 60% dafa sahi hota hai

- George Soros: sahi hone se zyada zaroori hai ke jab sahi ho to zyada kamao aur ghalat ho to kam ghao

Final Lesson

- Failure normal hai

- Ghaltiyan normal hain

- Success few rare wins se aati hai

- Sabr aur survival se tails ka faida milta hai

Aur sab se bari baat:
Aap ka zinda hona hi aik giant tail event hai.
