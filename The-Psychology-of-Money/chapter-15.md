## **Nothing's Free**
---

##  ENGLISH SUMMARY (Simple & Clear)

This chapter explains that **nothing valuable in life is free**, including successful investing. Everything has a price, and success comes from recognizing that price and being willing to pay it.

The author uses General Electric (GE) as an example. For years, GE appeared stable and predictable under CEO Jack Welch, who smoothed earnings to avoid volatility. Investors enjoyed consistency without feeling pain—but the bill eventually came due. When reality hit, losses were massive.

The same idea applies to investing. The stock market has delivered excellent long-term returns, but the price of those returns is **volatility, fear, and uncertainty**. Market crashes, drawdowns, and emotional stress are not mistakes or punishments—they are the **fee you pay for higher returns**.

Many investors try to avoid this price by timing the market, switching strategies, or using tactical funds. Studies show that most of these attempts fail. By trying to avoid volatility, investors often perform worse than those who simply buy and hold.

The key mindset shift is to view volatility as a **fee**, not a **fine**. A fee is something you willingly pay to get something valuable—like a Disneyland ticket. A fine feels like punishment for doing something wrong.

When investors see market declines as fines, they panic and quit. When they see them as fees, they stay invested long enough for compounding to work.

**Conclusion:**
Market returns are never free. If you want higher returns, you must accept uncertainty and volatility as the cost of admission. Find the price—and be willing to pay it.

##  ROMAN URDU SUMMARY (Dost ko samjhanay ke liye)

Is chapter ka seedha sa message yeh hai:

👉 **Zindagi mein kuch bhi free nahi hota — investing bhi nahi.**

Har cheez ka aik price hota hai:

* Car ka paisa
* Ghar ka loan
* Vacation ka kharcha

Lekin **investment ka price paisa nahi hota**
Uska price hota hai:

* market ka upar neeche jana
* dar lagna
* uncertainty
* sabr ka test

GE ki example se author batata hai ke:

* Jab company ne volatility chhupa li
* Investors ko smooth returns diye
* To kuch time baad **bohat bara nuksan** hua

Same cheez investing mein hoti hai:

* Long-term returns bohat achay hote hain
* Lekin beech mein crashes aur losses aate hain

Masla tab hota hai jab log:
❌ Volatility se bachna chahte hain
❌ Market timing karte hain
❌ “Risk ke baghair return” dhundte hain

Result?
➡️ Aksar double nuksan

Sab se important mindset shift:

### **Volatility fine nahi, fee hai**

Fine = punishment (galti ki saza)
Fee = kuch acha paanay ki qeemat

Agar tum market girnay ko **fine** samjho ge:
➡️ panic
➡️ sell
➡️ regret

Agar tum usay **fee** samjho ge:
➡️ sabr
➡️ patience
➡️ compounding ka faida

📌 **Lesson:**
Return chahiye to price dena hi paray ga.
Question yeh nahi ke price hai ya nahi —
question yeh hai ke **tum denay ko tayyar ho ya nahi**.
