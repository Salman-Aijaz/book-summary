## **You'll change**
---

## 🔹 ENGLISH SUMMARY (Simple, Interview / Dost-Level)

This chapter explains that people are **terrible at predicting what they’ll want in the future**.

The author shares a story of a friend who struggled for years to become a doctor—against all odds. He succeeded, but years later he hated the profession because of stress and long hours. The dream version of being a doctor was very different from the reality.

Psychologists call this the **End of History Illusion**—the belief that we’ve finished changing and will remain the same person forever. In reality, our goals, values, and desires keep evolving throughout life.

This illusion makes long-term financial planning difficult. We make career and money decisions at 18, 25, or 30 based on who we are at that moment, not realizing we’ll be very different people later.

Because of this:

* Extreme frugality can lead to regret later in life
* Extreme work-for-money lifestyles can waste youth and health
* Both extremes create long-term dissatisfaction

The chapter argues for **balance**:
Moderate savings, moderate work hours, moderate lifestyle, and time for family. Balance increases the chances that you’ll stick with a plan long enough for compounding to work.

Another key lesson is to avoid **sunk cost fallacy**—continuing a career or financial plan just because you invested time or money into it earlier. If a plan no longer fits who you are, abandoning it early is often the smartest move.

**Conclusion:**
The best financial strategy is one that allows flexibility, accepts change, and avoids extremes—so you can endure long enough to benefit from compounding.

## 🔹 ROMAN URDU SUMMARY (Dost ko samjhanay ke liye)

Is chapter ka simple matlab yeh hai:

👉 **Insaan waqt ke sath badalta hai, lekin hum yeh maan’ne ko tayyar nahi hotay.**

Author apne dost ki kahani batata hai jo:

* Bohat ghareeb background se aya
* Bohat mehnat karke doctor bana
* Lekin baad mein us career se nafrat karne laga
  kyun ke stress aur working hours ne usay tod diya

Problem yeh hai ke:

* Goal imagine karna asaan hota hai
* Us goal ki **real life problems imagine karna mushkil**

Psychology isay kehti hai:

### **End of History Illusion**

Matlab:
Hum samajhtay hain ke “ab main final version hoon”,
jab ke asal mein hum aage bhi bohat change honay walay hotay hain.

Isi wajah se:

* 18 saal mein choose kiya gaya career
* 35 saal mein bilkul ghalat lag sakta hai

Is chapter ka strong message:
❌ Extreme saving
❌ Extreme paisay ke peeche bhagna
Dono future mein regret dete hain.

✅ Beech ka raasta best hota hai:

* Thori saving
* Thora free time
* Thora family time
* Thora kaam

Aur aik bohat important baat:
👉 **Sunk cost trap mein mat phanso**
Sirf is liye kisi career ya plan ko continue mat karo ke:
“Yaar itna time laga diya hai”

Agar plan tumhari current life ko suit nahi karta:
➡️ usay chhor dena weakness nahi, wisdom hai

📌 **Goal:**
Aisi zindagi aur financial plan banao jo tum change hone ke bawajood chala sako.
