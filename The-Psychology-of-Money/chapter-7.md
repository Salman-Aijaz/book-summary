## **Freedom**

## 🔹 Chapter 7 Summary (English) – *Freedom*

The chapter explains that the highest form of wealth is **freedom**—the ability to control your time and choices. People often chase money thinking it will make them happy, but research shows that happiness comes mainly from **control over one’s life**, not income, status, or possessions.

Psychologist Angus Campbell found that people who feel in control of their lives are consistently happier than those who don’t, regardless of wealth or education. Money’s true value lies in buying **time, flexibility, and independence**, not luxury.

Even small amounts of savings can drastically improve life: taking time off when sick, waiting for a better job, escaping a bad boss, or handling emergencies without panic. More wealth increases options—choosing flexible work, retiring on your own terms, or spending time with loved ones.

The author shares how a high-paying investment banking job made him miserable because it removed control over his time. Psychologists call this loss of autonomy **reactance**—people resent being forced, even into things they like.

Modern jobs demand constant mental effort, making work feel endless. Unlike earlier generations, many people now work with their minds, not hands, meaning work follows them everywhere. Despite being richer than ever, people feel more stressed because they’ve lost control over time.

The chapter concludes that money should be used to **buy freedom**, not stuff. Wisdom from the elderly confirms this: happiness comes from relationships, purpose, and time—not wealth comparisons.

## 🔹 Chapter 7 Summary (Roman Urdu)

Is chapter ka core idea ye hai ke **asal daulat freedom hai** — yaani apni zindagi aur time par control. Log paisa is liye kamana chahte hain ke wo khush ho jaen, lekin research batati hai ke **khushi ka sab se strong factor control hai**, na ke salary, ghar ya status.

Psychologist Angus Campbell ke mutabiq jo log apni life par control mehsoos karte hain, wo zyada khush hote hain — chahe wo ameer hon ya nahi. Paisay ki asli value luxury cheezon mein nahi, balkay **time, options aur independence** mein hai.

Thora sa paisa bhi life change kar sakta hai: bimari mein chhutti lena, buri job chhor kar better option ka wait karna, ya emergency mein panic na hona. Zyada paisa aur zyada choices deta hai — flexible job, early retirement, ya family ke sath waqt.

Author apna experience batata hai ke investment banking job achi thi, lekin time par control na hone ki wajah se wo miserable ho gaya. Is feeling ko psychology mein **reactance** kehte hain — jab hum force hone par cheez se nafrat mehsoos karte hain.

Aaj ke jobs zyada tar **mind-based** hain, is liye kaam office se bahar bhi dimagh mein chalta rehta hai. Hum pehle se zyada ameer hain, lekin time par control kam hone ki wajah se zyada stressed hain.

### **Chapter ka conclusion ye hai ke:**
💡 **Paisay ka best use freedom khareedna hai, cheezen nahi.**
Budhay log bhi yehi kehte hain ke khushi paisay se nahi, balkay time, rishton aur purpose se aati hai.
