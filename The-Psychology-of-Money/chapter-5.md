🔹 Summary (English)

This chapter focuses on staying wealthy, which is often harder than getting wealthy. While many people can make money, keeping it requires frugality, paranoia, and survival skills.

Key Stories:

1. Jesse Livermore (1877–1940)

 - Greatest stock trader of his era.

 - Made $3 billion (inflation-adjusted) in one day during the 1929 crash by shorting the market.

 - Later, overconfident and leveraged, he lost everything and eventually took his own life.

 - Lesson: Getting wealthy is one skill, staying wealthy is another.

2. Abraham Germansky

 - Multimillionaire real estate developer pre-1929.

 - Lost everything during the crash, possibly ended his own life.

 - Lesson: Wealth can vanish faster than it is created.

3. Rick Guerin

 - Early investment partner of Buffett & Munger.

 - As smart as them, but in a hurry; leveraged margin loans during 1973–74 downturn, forced to sell.

 - Lesson: Patience and survival matter more than raw intelligence or skill.

## Core Principles of Staying Wealthy:

1. Survival Over Returns

 - Avoid ruin. Big gains are useless if you can’t survive market downturns.

 - Example: Holding cash in a bear market may feel conservative, but prevents desperate selling, allowing compounding to work.

2. Plan for Reality, Not Ideal

 - Always assume plans won’t go perfectly.

 - Include margin of safety (flexible timelines, frugal budget, adaptable thinking).

 - Most bets fail because the situation required exact conditions.

3. Barbelled Mindset: Optimistic + Paranoid

 - Be optimistic about long-term growth but paranoid about short-term risks.

 - Life, markets, and economies grow amid setbacks.

 - Example: Over 170 years in the U.S.:
    - 1.3 million Americans died in nine major wars

    - 4 U.S. presidents assassinated

    - 675,000 deaths in a single flu year

    - 33 recessions totaling 48 years

    - Stocks fell 10%+ at least 102 times, lost 1/3 value 12 times

    - Annual inflation >7% in 20 years

    - ~99.9% of all companies created went out of business

    - Yet, standard of living increased 20-fold

 - Lesson: Survive short-term chaos to exploit long-term growth.

## Takeaways:

- Frugality + paranoia = longevity in wealth

- Compound growth only works if you survive the unpredictable ups and downs

- Staying wealthy is harder than getting wealthy, and survival is the ultimate skill.
