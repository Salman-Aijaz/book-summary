## **Never Enough**

## 🔹 Summary (English)

This chapter explains the powerful and often overlooked idea of “enough”—knowing when to stop chasing more money, power, or status.

John Bogle shares a story where author Joseph Heller says that despite earning less than a billionaire hedge fund manager, he has something the billionaire may never have: enough. The chapter argues that many people, including the extremely wealthy, lack a sense of what is enough, which leads them to take unnecessary and dangerous risks.

The stories of Rajat Gupta and Bernie Madoff illustrate this danger. Both men were already extraordinarily wealthy, powerful, and respected. Yet they committed crimes—not because they needed money, but because they wanted more. Their inability to stop, to recognize that they already had enough, destroyed their reputations, freedom, and lives.

The chapter shows that this behavior isn’t limited to criminals. Many investors and professionals risk everything they have for gains they don’t need, driven by greed, envy, and social comparison. The problem is that comparison has no ceiling—there is always someone richer.

Key lessons include:

- The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.

- Social comparison is a losing game; the only way to win is to stop playing.

- Having “enough” is not a weakness or lack of ambition—it’s protection against regret.

- Some things are never worth risking, no matter the potential reward: reputation, freedom, relationships, happiness, and peace of mind.

The chapter concludes that happiness comes from managing expectations, not endlessly increasing results. Knowing when you have enough is one of the most important financial and life skills.

## 🔹 Summary (Roman Urdu)

Is chapter ka core idea “enough” hai—yaani yeh samajhna ke kab ruk jana chahiye. Bohat se log, hatta ke bohat ameer aur powerful log bhi, kabhi yeh decide nahi kar paate ke unke liye kaafi kya hai.

Joseph Heller ki example se yeh baat samajh aati hai ke zyada paisa hona zaroori nahi ke zyada sukoon bhi ho. Asal cheez yeh hai ke aap ko lagta hai ke mere paas kaafi hai.

Rajat Gupta aur Bernie Madoff ki kahaniyan is baat ka saboot hain ke jab “enough” ka concept na ho to insan sab kuch daon par laga deta hai—izzat, azadi, career, aur zindagi. Dono ke paas already bohat kuch tha, lekin phir bhi “aur” chahte rahe, aur sab kho diya.

Yeh sirf criminals ka masla nahi. Aam log bhi aksar comparison ki wajah se unnecessary risk lete hain. Masla yeh hai ke social comparison ki koi limit nahi hoti—hamesha koi na koi aapse zyada ameer hota hai.

Chapter ke main lessons:

- Sab se mushkil financial skill yeh hai ke goalpost ko move hone se roka jaye.

- Comparison aik aisi game hai jo jeeti nahi ja sakti—sirf chhor kar hi jeeti ja sakti hai.

- “Enough” ka matlab kam ambition nahi, balkay future regret se protection hai.

- Kuch cheezen kabhi bhi risk nahi karni chahiye: reputation, freedom, family, dosti, aur khushi.

Akhir mein message yeh hai ke khushi zyada hasil karne se nahi, balkay expectations control karne se aati hai. “Enough” ko pehchanna aik bohat bari zindagi ki skill hai.
