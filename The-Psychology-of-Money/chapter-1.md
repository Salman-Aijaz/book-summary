## No one's Crazy

🔹 Chapter 1 Summary (English)
The core idea of this chapter is that people are not crazy with money; they are shaped by their experiences.

Everyone grows up in different economic conditions—different generations, countries, job markets, inflation levels, and opportunities. These experiences deeply influence how people think about money, risk, saving, and investing. What seems irrational or foolish to one person may make complete sense to another because they lived through different realities.

Personal experiences form a very small part of world history, but they strongly shape how individuals believe the world works. This explains why equally intelligent people can strongly disagree about investing, inflation, stocks, and financial decisions.

The chapter shows that emotions and lived experiences matter more than data or spreadsheets. Historical knowledge alone cannot recreate the fear, uncertainty, and emotional scars caused by real financial crises like the Great Depression.

Research shows that people’s investment decisions are strongly influenced by economic conditions they experienced early in life. Luck—such as being born at the right time—often matters more than intelligence or education.

The chapter also explains why behaviors like buying lottery tickets or making poor financial choices are not “stupidity” but attempts to cope with limited opportunities and harsh realities.

Finally, the author explains that modern financial systems—retirement planning, investing, index funds, student loans—are very new concepts. Humans are still learning how to deal with them. So financial mistakes are natural.
Conclusion:

People make money decisions that make sense to them based on their personal experiences. No one is crazy—just different.

🔹 Chapter 1 Summary (Urdu – Roman Urdu)
Is chapter ka main point yeh hai ke paise ke maamlay mein koi bhi pagal nahi hota, balkay har insaan apni zindagi ke tajurbon ki bunyaad par faislay karta hai.

Log mukhtalif halaat mein palay barhay hotay hain—kisi ne mehngai dekhi, kisi ne recession, kisi ne amiri, kisi ne ghurbat. In tajurbon ki wajah se har shakhs ka paisay ko dekhne ka nazariya mukhtalif hota hai. Jo cheez humein ghalat ya ajeeb lagti hai, woh doosray ke liye bilkul logical ho sakti hai.

Hum jo khud experience karte hain, woh hum par kitabon ya data se zyada asar karta hai. Is liye do barabar aqalmand log bhi investment, risk, aur paisay ke bare mein bilkul mukhtalif raaye rakh sakte hain.

Sirf history parhna kaafi nahi hota. Jab tak insaan khud loss, khauf aur uncertainty se nahi guzarta, uska rawaiya change nahi hota.

Research yeh batati hai ke jo economic halaat hum jawani mein dekhte hain, wahi baad mein humare investment decisions ko control karte hain. Aqal se zyada qismat ka role hota hai—kab aur kahan paida huay.

Lottery tickets khareedna ya ghalat financial decisions lena aksar majboori aur umeed ki wajah se hota hai, na ke bewaqoofi se.

Aakhri baat yeh ke modern finance (retirement, investing, loans) bohat naya system hai. Insani tareekh ke muqable mein hum is game ke bilkul beginners hain.

## **Natija:**

Har insaan apni kahani ke mutabiq paisay ke faislay karta hai. Is liye koi pagal nahi—sirf mukhtalif tajurbon ka asar hai.
