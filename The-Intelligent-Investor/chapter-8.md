# **CHAPTER 8**
## **The Investor and Market Fluctuations**

---

## CHAPTER CORE IDEA (English)

This chapter explains how **market fluctuations** should be viewed by an **investor**, not a **speculator**.

* Stock prices will fluctuate — this is **normal and unavoidable**
* The intelligent investor does **not try to predict the market**
* Market movements are **tools**, not signals to panic
* **Timing the market** turns investors into speculators
* **Pricing (value-based buying & selling)** is the correct approach
* The market often misprices even excellent companies
* The investor should use market drops to **buy wisely**, and market booms to **sell cautiously**
* Emotional reactions to price movements are the biggest enemy
* Bonds also fluctuate, especially long-term bonds
* No formula, theory, or mechanical system works forever

## CHAPTER CORE IDEA (Roman Urdu)

Yeh chapter samjhata hai ke **market ke utar-chadhaav (price fluctuations)** ko ek **samajhdar investor** kaise dekhta hai — na ke ek **speculator**.

* Stock prices ka upar-neeche hona **bilkul normal hai**
* Samajhdar investor **market predict karne ki koshish nahi karta**
* Market movements **panic ka signal nahi**, balkay **opportunity** hoti hain

* **Pricing ya value ke basis par buy/sell karna** sahi approach hai
* Market aksar **bohot achi companies ko bhi ghalat price** karta hai
* Girawat mein **samajhdari se khareedna**, aur bohot zyada upar jaane par **ehteyat se bechna**
* Jazbati faislay investor ka sab se bara dushman hain
* Bonds bhi fluctuate kartay hain, khas taur par long-term bonds
* Koi bhi formula ya theory hamesha kaam nahi karti

##  INVESTOR vs SPECULATOR (English)

**Speculator**

* Focus: Price movement
* Goal: Fast profit
* Emotion-driven
* Tries to forecast market

**Investor**

* Focus: Business value
* Goal: Long-term growth + income
* Calm and disciplined
* Uses price swings, doesn’t fear them

---

##  INVESTOR vs SPECULATOR (Roman Urdu)

**Speculator**

* Sirf price movement dekhta hai
* Jaldi paisa kamana chahta hai
* Jazbat ke saath trade karta hai
* Market future predict karta hai

**Investor**

* Business ki asli value dekhta hai
* Long-term sochta hai
* Sabar aur discipline rakhta hai
* Price swings ko use karta hai, darta nahi

---

##  MARKET TIMING vs PRICING (English)

* **Timing** = guessing future → mostly fails
* **Pricing** = buying below value → works over time

Trying to wait for the “perfect time” usually means:

* Missing dividends
* Missing opportunities
* Becoming speculative

---

##  MARKET TIMING vs PRICING (Roman Urdu)

* **Timing** = future ka andaaza → zyada tar fail
* **Pricing** = value se kam par khareedna → long term kaam karta hai

“Perfect time” ka intezar aksar:

* Income miss karwa deta hai
* Opportunities miss karwa deta hai
* Investor ko speculator bana deta hai

##  MR. MARKET PARABLE (English)

The market is like a moody partner:

* Every day he offers you a price
* Sometimes stupidly high
* Sometimes foolishly low

You are **not forced** to act.
You should act **only when the price benefits you**.

---

##  MR. MARKET PARABLE (Roman Urdu)

Market ek **mizaaji partner** jaisa hai:

* Roz naya price deta hai
* Kabhi bohot zyada mehnga
* Kabhi bohot sasta

Tum majboor nahi ho react karne ke liye.
Sirf tab action lo jab price **tumhare faiday mein ho**.

##  BUY LOW – SELL HIGH (Reality Check)

**English**

* Sounds easy
* Very hard in practice
* Markets don’t repeat perfectly
* Old formulas stop working once popular

**Roman Urdu**

* Sun’ne mein easy
* Amal mein mushkil
* Market same pattern follow nahi karti
* Jo system mashhoor ho jaye, woh fail ho jata hai

---

## STOCKS vs BUSINESS VALUE (English)

* Stock price ≠ Business value
* Great companies often fluctuate **more**
* High-quality stocks can be **more speculative** due to high expectations
* Paying too much for quality is dangerous

---

## STOCKS vs BUSINESS VALUE (Roman Urdu)

* Stock price aur business value same cheez nahi
* Achi companies ke shares aksar **zyada hilte hain**
* Bohot mehngi quality bhi risk hoti hai
* Sirf “acha business” hona kaafi nahi, **price bhi sahi honi chahiye**

---

## BONDS FLUCTUATION (English)

* Long-term bonds fluctuate heavily with interest rates
* Short-term bonds are more stable
* Predicting bond prices is impossible
* Choose bonds based on **personal comfort**, not forecasts

---

## BONDS FLUCTUATION (Roman Urdu)

* Long-term bonds interest rate ke sath bohot hilte hain
* Short-term bonds zyada stable hotay hain
* Bond prices predict karna namumkin hai
* Bonds apni **comfort level** ke hisaab se chuno, prediction par nahi

---
