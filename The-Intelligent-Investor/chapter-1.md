## 1. Investor vs Speculator

### 📝 English Summary

#### 1.1 Definition of Investor

* An **investor** is someone who, after proper analysis, aims for:
  * **Safety of principal (capital protection)**
  * **Adequate return**
* Anything that does **not** meet these two conditions is called **speculation**.

#### 1.2 Confusion in Modern Usage

* Earlier (1930s–1940s), **stocks were considered risky and speculative**.
* Later, when stock prices went high and risky, people started calling **everyone an "investor"**, even reckless traders.
* This created **confusion between investing and speculation**.

#### 1.3 Danger of Mislabeling

* Calling speculators "investors" hides real risk.
* This can mislead people and cause heavy losses.
* Even stock exchanges themselves suffered losses by treating speculative stocks as investments.

#### 1.4 Speculation is Not Evil — But Needs Limits

* Speculation is:
  * Not illegal
  * Not immoral
  * Sometimes necessary
* There is **intelligent speculation** and **unintelligent speculation**.

#### 1.5 Three Major Mistakes in Speculation

1. Thinking you are investing when you are actually speculating.
2. Serious speculation without enough knowledge or skill.
3. Risking more money than you can afford to lose.

#### 1.6 Margin & Hot Stocks

* Anyone buying on **margin** is automatically speculating.
* Buying "hot stocks" is speculation or gambling.
* Keep speculation **separate** from investments.

#### 1.7 Defensive Investor

* A defensive investor wants:
  * Safety
  * Peace of mind
* He must accept that:
  * Even good stocks now contain some speculative risk
  * The goal is to **keep that risk limited**

#### 1.1 Investor aur Speculator ka Farq

* Jis mein ye cheezen na hon, wo **speculation** hai.

#### 1.2 Logon ki Ghalat Soch

#### 1.3 Ye Ghalat Istemaal Kyun Khatarnaak Hai

* Risk chhup jata hai.

* Khud stock exchange firms ko bhi nuqsan hua.

#### 1.4 Speculation Ghalat Nahi — Lekin Had Mein

* Speculation:
  * Na haram hai
  * Na ghalat
  * Kabhi kabhi zaroori bhi hoti hai
* Magar aqal ke sath honi chahiye.

#### 1.5 Speculation ki 3 Bari Ghaltiyan

1. Speculation ko investment samajhna.
2. Baghair knowledge ke serious speculation karna.
3. Itna paisa lagana jo bardasht na ho sake.

#### 1.6 Margin aur Hot Stocks

* Margin par buying = **100% speculation**
* "Hot stock" khareedna = gambling ya speculation
* Speculation ka paisa **alag** rakho.

#### 1.7 Defensive Investor

* Defensive investor chahta hai:
  * Safety
  * Tension se doori

## 2. Portfolio Allocation Rules

### 📝 English Summary

#### 2.1 Portfolio Allocation Rule

* Investors should split their money between:
  * **High-grade bonds**
  * **Leading common stocks**
* Bonds should be:
  * **Minimum 25%**
  * **Maximum 75%**
* Stocks will naturally be the opposite percentage.

#### 2.2 Simple & Practical Strategy

* Best and simplest approach:
  * **50% bonds / 50% stocks**
* Rebalance the portfolio if market changes disturb this balance by around **5%**.

#### 2.3 Flexible Strategy Based on Market Conditions

* Reduce stocks to **25%** if the market looks **dangerously high**.
* Increase stocks up to **75%** if prices fall and stocks become **attractive**.

#### 2.4 Returns in 1965

* High-grade taxable bonds gave around **4.5% return**.
* Tax-free bonds gave around **3.25%**.
* Stock dividends were only about **3.2%**, which suggested caution.

#### 2.5 Expected Long-Term Stock Return

* Normal expected stock return:
  * **3.5–4.5% dividends**
  * Plus **similar growth in value**
* Total expected stock return ≈ **7.5% per year**.

#### 2.6 Combined Portfolio Return

* A 50–50 mix of stocks and bonds would yield about **6% annually before tax**.

#### 2.7 Inflation Protection

* Stock portion should help protect against:
  * **Loss of purchasing power due to inflation**.

#### 2.8 Warning About Past Performance

* Stock market growth from **1949–1964** averaged over **10%**, which was unusually high.
* Many people wrongly assumed:
  * Past high returns guaranteed future high returns.
* Authors warned:
  * High past growth may actually mean **stocks are now overpriced**.
  * Future returns could be **worse, not better**.

---

### 📝 Roman Urdu Summary

#### 2.1 Portfolio Ka Basic Rule

* Investor ko apna paisa divide karna chahiye:
  * **Achay bonds**
  * **Leading common stocks**
* Bonds:
  * Kam az kam **25%**
  * Zyada se zyada **75%**
* Stocks ka hissa is ka ulta hoga.

#### 2.2 Sab Se Aasan Strategy

* Behtareen aur simple option:
  * **50% bonds + 50% stocks**
* Jab market move ki wajah se balance **5%** se zyada bigar jaye, to **rebalance** karo.

#### 2.3 Market Dekh Kar Adjustment

* Agar market bohat mehngi lage:
  * Stocks ko **25%** tak kam karo.
* Agar prices gir jayein aur stocks cheap lagne lagen:
  * Stocks ko **75%** tak barhao.

#### 2.4 1965 Mein Returns

* Achay taxable bonds ≈ **4.5%**
* Tax-free bonds ≈ **3.25%**
* Stocks ka dividend ≈ **3.2%**
* Is ka matlab: **caution zaroori thi**.

#### 2.5 Long-Term Stock Return Expectation

* Normal halat mein stocks se:
  * **3.5–4.5% dividend**
  * Itni hi growth
* Total ≈ **7.5% saalana**

#### 2.6 Mixed Portfolio Ka Result

* 50–50 portfolio:
  * ≈ **6% return (tax se pehle)**

#### 2.7 Inflation Se Bachao

* Stocks ka hissa:
  * Mehengai ki wajah se paisay ki value girne se bachata hai.

#### 2.8 Past Performance Ka Dhoka

* 1949–1964 mein stocks ne **10%+ growth** di.
* Log samajhne lage:
  * Ye future mein bhi hoga.
* Authors ne warn kiya:
  * Zyada past growth ka matlab ho sakta hai stocks **ab mehngay** hain.
  * Future returns **kam ya negative** ho sakte hain.

## 3. Market Changes Since 1964

### 📝 English Summary

#### 3.1 Major Change After 1964

* The biggest change was a **sharp rise in interest rates**.
* High-grade corporate bonds now offered around **7.5% return**, compared to **4.5% in 1964**.
* Bond prices fell heavily, especially around **1970**, before partial recovery.

#### 3.2 Stock Dividends vs Bonds

* Dividend yield on DJIA-type stocks rose slightly during the 1969–70 market fall.
* Still, with Dow around **900**, dividend yield was **below 3.5%**, only slightly better than **3.2% in 1964**.
* Bonds became **much more attractive income-wise** than stocks.

#### 3.3 Heavy Losses in Long-Term Bonds

* Medium- to long-term bonds (around 20 years) suffered:
  * **Up to 38% decline in market price**.
* This was surprising because bonds were considered "safe."

#### 3.4 The Paradox

* Authors warned that **stocks might be overpriced**, but did NOT seriously consider:
  * That **high-grade bonds could also fall sharply**.
* Though they mentioned bond prices fluctuate with interest rates, the risk was **underestimated**.

#### 3.5 Stocks vs Bonds Performance

* If an investor bought DJIA stocks in 1964:
  * Small profit by 1971
  * Even at the 1970 bottom, losses were **less than long-term bonds**
* Long-term bonds actually did **worse than stocks** in price decline.

#### 3.6 Cash Equivalents Performed Best

* Investors holding:
  * U.S. savings bonds
  * Short-term corporate bonds
  * Savings accounts
* Had:
  * **No loss of principal**
  * **Higher income than stocks**
* Surprisingly, **cash did better than stocks**, despite inflation.

#### 3.7 Lesson on Predictability

* The future of security prices is **never predictable**.
* Bonds usually fluctuate less than stocks — but **1964–1970 was a rare exception**.
* Money-market forces (usually ignored by individuals) caused major bond losses.

### 📝 Roman Urdu Summary

#### 3.1 1964 Ke Baad Sab Se Bari Tabdeeli

* Sab se bari change:
  * **Interest rates ka bohat zyada barhna**
* Achay corporate bonds:
  * **7.5% return** dene lage (1964 mein sirf 4.5% tha)
* 1970 ke aas paas bond prices bohat gir gaye.

#### 3.2 Stocks vs Bonds Income

* 1969–70 ke crash mein stocks ka dividend thora barha.
* Phir bhi Dow 900 par:
  * Dividend **3.5% se kam** raha.
* Bonds income ke liye **stocks se zyada attractive** ho gaye.

#### 3.3 Long-Term Bonds Ka Bara Nuqsan

* 20 saal ke qareeb bonds:
  * **38% tak gir gaye**
* Jo cheez "safe" samjhi jati thi, us mein bhi heavy loss hua.

#### 3.4 Paradox (Ulti Baat)

* Authors ne stocks ke mehngay honay ka risk bataya tha,
* Lekin ye socha hi nahi tha ke:
  * **High-grade bonds bhi itna gir sakte hain**
* Bond risk ko **kam samjha gaya**.

#### 3.5 Stocks aur Bonds ka Muqabla

* 1964 mein DJIA stocks lene wala investor:
  * 1971 tak halka sa profit mein tha
  * 1970 ke lowest point par bhi loss:
    * Long-term bonds se kam tha
* Matlab:
  * Bonds stocks se zyada gire.

#### 3.6 Cash Equivalents Sab Se Behtar Niklay

* Jo log:
  * Savings bonds
  * Short-term bonds
  * Bank savings mein thay
* Unka:
  * Capital safe raha
  * Income stocks se zyada rahi
* Inflation ke bawajood:
  * **Cash ne stocks ko beat kiya**

#### 3.7 Sab Se Bari Seekh

* Future prices ka andaza **kabhi perfect nahi hota**.
* Normally bonds stable hotay hain,
* Magar **1964–1970 ek rare exception** tha.
* Money market ke factors ne bonds ko nuksan pohanchaya — jo aam investors ignore karte hain.

## 4. Expectations and Policy (1971-1972)

### 📝 English Summary

#### 4.1 Market Situation in Late 1971

* Investors could earn:
  * **8% taxable interest** on good medium-term corporate bonds
  * **5.7% tax-free** on municipal/state bonds
  * **6%** on 5-year U.S. government bonds (with no market-value risk)
* DJIA stocks at around **900** yielded only **3.5% dividends**.

👉 Bonds were clearly offering **higher and safer income** than stocks.

#### 4.2 Expected Returns on Stocks

* Defensive investor could expect:
  * **3.5% dividend yield**
  * Plus about **4% annual appreciation**
* Total **before-tax stock return ≈ 7.5%**
* **After-tax stock return ≈ 5.3%**
* This was roughly **equal to tax-free bond returns**.

#### 4.3 Stocks vs Bonds: 1971 Reality

* Compared to 1964:
  * Bond yields increased **much more** than stock yields.
* Bonds provide:
  * **More certainty**
  * **Better protection of principal**
* Conclusion:
  * In late 1971, **bonds appeared more attractive than stocks**.

#### 4.4 Why Not 100% Bonds?

Even though bonds looked better, certainty was impossible because:

* Inflation could unexpectedly rise
* Business profits could grow sharply
* Another speculative stock-market boom could occur

👉 Any of these could make stocks outperform bonds.

#### 4.5 Core Policy (Still the Same)

* Defensive investors should:
  * **Always hold both bonds and stocks**
* Two acceptable strategies:
  * **50% bonds / 50% stocks**
  * Flexible range: **25%–75%** in either, based on judgment

👉 Expected overall return stays similar regardless of mix.

#### 4.6 Expected Overall Return

* Combined portfolio return:
  * **~7.8% before tax**
  * **~5.5% after tax**
* This is:
  * Better than what conservative investors historically earned
  * Lower than the **14% stock returns after 1949**

#### 4.7 Why Past Returns Were Misleading

* From 1949–1969:
  * DJIA prices rose **5×**
  * Earnings/dividends only **2×**
* Most gains came from:
  * Changing investor psychology
  * Not real business growth
* Authors call this a **"bootstrap operation"**.

#### 4.8 Stock Selection for Defensive Investors

* Focus on:
  * Large, stable, financially strong companies
* Not limited only to Dow 30 stocks
* Beating the market consistently is **very unlikely**
* Even experts usually fail to outperform reliably.

#### 4.9 Warning Against "Hot" Stocks

* Buying:
  * New issues
  * Hot tips
  * Quick-profit recommendations
* Almost guarantees **below-average results** long-term.

#### 4.10 Additional Tools for Defensive Investors

1. **Investment funds / mutual funds**
2. **Professional investment counsel**
3. **Dollar-cost averaging**
   * Invest same amount regularly
   * Buy more when prices are low, less when high
4. **Formula investing**
   * Adjust stock/bond ratio opposite to market movements

### 📝 Roman Urdu Summary

#### 4.1 1971 Ke Aakhir Ka Haal

* Achay bonds par returns:
  * **8% taxable**
  * **5.7% tax-free**
  * **6% U.S. govt bonds (5 saal)**
* Stocks ka dividend sirf **3.5%** tha.

👉 Is waqt bonds **zyada safe aur profitable** lag rahe thay.

#### 4.2 Stocks Se Kya Expect Kiya Ja Sakta Tha

* Defensive investor ko:
  * **3.5% dividend**
  * **4% growth**
* Total:
  * **7.5% before tax**
  * **5.3% after tax**

#### 4.3 Stocks vs Bonds (1971)

* 1964 ke muqable mein:
  * Bonds ke returns zyada barh chuke thay
* Bonds:
  * Zyada reliable
  * Capital zyada mehfooz
* Is liye:
  * **Bonds zyada attractive lag rahe thay**

#### 4.4 Phir 100% Bonds Kyun Nahi?

Kyun ke future confirm nahi hota:

* Inflation tez ho sakti hai
* Business profits barh sakte hain
* Stock market phir speculative boom dekh sakta hai

👉 Is liye sirf bonds par jana risky ho sakta hai.

#### 4.5 Final Policy (Wohi Purani)

* Defensive investor ko:
  * **Bonds + Stocks dono rakhne chahiye**
* Options:
  * **50–50**
  * Ya **25% se 75%** ke beech adjustment

#### 4.6 Expected Total Return

* Overall return:
  * **7.8% before tax**
  * **5.5% after tax**
* Ye:
  * Past conservative returns se behtar hai
  * Magar post-1949 boom jaisa nahi

#### 4.7 Past Boom Ka Sach

* 1949–1969 mein:
  * Prices 5 guna
  * Earnings sirf 2 guna
* Matlab:
  * Growth zyada tar logon ki soch ki wajah se thi
* Isay authors ne:
  * **"Bootstrap operation"** kaha

#### 4.8 Defensive Investor Ke Liye Stocks

* Sirf:
  * Bari, stable, financially strong companies
* Dow ke ilawa bhi achi companies hoti hain
* Market ko consistently beat karna:
  * **Lagbhag namumkin**

#### 4.9 "Hot Stocks" Se Warning

* New issues
* Quick profit tips
* Hot recommendations

👉 Long-term mein aksar **nuksan** deti hain.

#### 4.10 Extra Useful Techniques

1. **Mutual funds**
2. **Professional advisors**
3. **Dollar-cost averaging**
   * Har mahina same paisa invest karna
4. **Formula investing**
   * Market gire → stocks barhao
   * Market chadhe → stocks kam karo

## 5. Aggressive vs Defensive Investor

### 📝 English Summary

#### 5.1 Aggressive Investor's Goal

* An aggressive (enterprising) investor wants **better-than-average returns**.
* First priority:
  * Make sure results are **not worse** than a defensive investor.
* Energy, intelligence, and effort **do not guarantee profits**.
* If used wrongly, these strengths can **cause losses**.

#### 5.2 Common Methods Used to Beat the Market

##### (a) Market Trading

* Buying stocks after prices rise.
* Selling after prices start falling.
* Includes **short selling** (selling borrowed shares to profit from price declines).
* Authors clearly reject trading as a sound investment method.

##### (b) Short-Term Selectivity

* Buying stocks with:
  * Rising earnings
  * Good expected near-term news
* Problem:
  * This information is usually **already priced in**.

##### (c) Long-Term Selectivity

* Buying companies with:
  * Strong past growth
  * Promising future potential (often tech, pharma, electronics)
* Risk:
  * Forecasting long-term success is **very difficult**.

#### 5.3 Why These Methods Usually Fail

* Two major obstacles:
  1. **Human error** (wrong predictions)
  2. **Professional competition** (Wall Street already knows)
* Even if predictions are correct:
  * Market prices often already reflect them.
* Beating professional analysts consistently is **highly unlikely**.

#### 5.4 Key Conclusion (Very Important)

To achieve above-average results, an investor must follow strategies that:

1. Are **logically sound**
2. Are **unpopular on Wall Street**

#### 5.5 Mispricing Exists — But Is Hard to Exploit

* Stocks often become:
  * **Overvalued** due to popularity
  * **Undervalued** due to neglect or prejudice
* In theory:
  * Smart investors should profit from others' mistakes.
* In practice:
  * Undervalued stocks take **a long time** to rise.
  * Short selling overvalued stocks is:
    * Financially risky
    * Psychologically stressful
* Principle is correct, execution is **difficult**.

#### 5.6 Special Situations (Historically Profitable)

Examples include:

* Merger arbitrage
* Liquidations
* Workouts
* Certain hedged positions

**Past Results:**
* Historically delivered **~20% annual returns**
* With relatively low risk

**Why They Became Less Profitable:**
* Too much competition
* More failed mergers
* Returns declined over time

#### 5.7 Vanishing Opportunities (Key Insight)

* Many once-reliable strategies stopped working because:
  * Too many people started using them
* Examples:
  * Formula based on earnings & interest rates (worked before 1949)
  * Dow Theory (great before 1934, weak after)
  * Buying stocks below net working capital (very successful pre-1960s)

👉 Markets **adapt and destroy easy profits**.

#### 5.8 Rare Opportunities Reappear Occasionally

* In 1970, market crash created:
  * Many stocks selling below working-capital value again
* Such opportunities:
  * Are rare
  * Appear mostly during **severe market declines**

#### 5.9 Final View on Aggressive Investing

* Even today, some stocks are:
  * Logically identifiable as **undervalued**
* Aggressive investing is worth the effort **only if**:
  * It can add **~5% extra return (before tax)** over market average
* Otherwise:
  * The extra work and risk are **not justified**

---

### 📝 Roman Urdu Summary

#### 5.1 Aggressive Investor Kya Chahta Hai

* Aggressive investor ka goal:
  * **Market se behtar returns**
* Pehla rule:
  * Defensive investor se **bura result na aaye**
* Sirf mehnat aur intelligence:
  * Profit ki guarantee nahi hoti
* Ghalat direction mein effort:
  * **Nuksan** ban jata hai

#### 5.2 Market Ko Beat Karne Ke Aam Tareeqay

##### (a) Trading

* Market upar jaaye → buy
* Neeche aaye → sell
* Short selling bhi shamil
* Authors ke mutabiq:
  * Trading **investment nahi** hai

##### (b) Short-Term Selection

* Rising earnings wali companies khareedna
* Masla:
  * Ye news pehle hi price mein hoti hai

##### (c) Long-Term Selection

* Strong growth wali companies
* Future success ka andaza lagana:
  * **Bohat mushkil**

#### 5.3 Ye Tareeqay Kyun Fail Hote Hain

* Do bari rukawatein:
  1. Insani ghalti
  2. Wall Street professionals
* Sahi guess ke bawajood:
  * Price pehle hi adjust ho chuki hoti hai
* Experts ko consistently beat karna:
  * **Na-mumkin ke qareeb**

#### 5.4 Sab Se Bari Conclusion

Aggressive investor ko:

* **Aisi strategies follow karni chahiye jo**
  1. Logic par based hon
  2. Wall Street mein popular na hon

#### 5.5 Undervalued / Overvalued Stocks

* Overvalued:
  * Zyada popular hone ki wajah se
* Undervalued:
  * Logon ki interest na honay ki wajah se
* Theory mein profit easy lagta hai
* Reality mein:
  * Patience aur himmat chahiye

#### 5.6 Special Situations

* Mergers
* Liquidations
* Arbitrage
* Hedged deals

👉 Pehle:
* **20%+ returns** milte thay

👉 Baad mein:
* Competition ki wajah se profits kam ho gaye

#### 5.7 Opportunities Kyun Khatam Ho Jati Hain

* Jab zyada log ek strategy use karte hain:
  * Wo kaam karna band kar deti hai
* Examples:
  * Old valuation formulas
  * Dow Theory
  * Net working capital stocks

#### 5.8 Kab Kab Phir Mauqay Milte Hain

* Sirf:
  * Market crash
  * Panic ke waqt
* 1970 ke baad:
  * Aise stocks dobara mile

#### 5.9 Final Advice

* Aggressive investing tab hi worth it hai jab:
  * **Market se 5% extra return** mile
* Warna:
  * Time, stress aur risk ka faida nahi
