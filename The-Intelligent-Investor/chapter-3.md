# **The Intelligent Investor – A Century of Stock-Market History: The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972**

---

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Is chapter mein Benjamin Graham investor ko yeh samjhate hain ke stock market sirf aaj ki prices dekh kar samajhna kaafi nahi hota. Aik samajhdaar investor ke liye zaroori hai ke woh **stock market ki history** ko samjhe — khaaskar **bull aur bear markets**, price fluctuations, earnings aur dividends ke sath unka relationship.

Graham batate hain ke pichlay 100 saalon mein stock market ne bohot se cycles dekhe hain. Kabhi market bohot tez upar gayi, kabhi achanak neeche giri. Long term mein stocks ne growth dikhai hai, lekin yeh growth **seedhi line** mein nahi hoti. Is liye short-term moves par overreact karna ghalat hota hai.

Unhon ne dikhaya ke **1949 se 1968** tak market ne extraordinary returns diye, jis ki wajah se logon ko yeh ghalat guman ho gaya ke stocks hamesha aise hi returns denge. Isi overconfidence ka nateeja tha ke jab **1969–1970** mein market gira to bohot log mentally aur financially tayar nahi thay.

Chapter ka aik bohot important point yeh hai ke **valuation ratios** (jaise P/E ratio aur dividend yield) waqt ke sath bohot change hue. 1949 mein stocks saste thay aur dividends zyada mil rahe thay, jab ke 1970 ke baad stocks mehngay aur dividends comparatively kam ho gaye, jab ke bonds zyada attractive lagne lage.

Graham repeatedly yeh emphasize karte hain ke **market ka exact future predict karna namumkin hai**. Har dafa jab unhon ne market level ko judge karne ki koshish ki, kabhi woh sahi niklay, kabhi zyada cautious ho gaye. Is se yeh lesson milta hai ke market timing par zyada bharosa nahi karna chahiye.

Aakhir mein Graham ka conclusion yeh hai ke sab se behtar approach yeh hai:

* Market ko beat karne ki koshish na karo
* Speculation se door raho
* **Consistent, disciplined investment policy** follow karo
* Aur jab market mehngi lagay, to **cautious rehna behtar hota hai**

## **Summary in English**

In this chapter, Benjamin Graham explains that a smart investor must understand **stock market history**, not just current prices. Knowledge of past bull and bear markets, price fluctuations, and the relationship between prices, earnings, and dividends is essential for sound judgment.

Graham shows that over the past 100 years, the stock market has moved through many cycles. While stocks have grown significantly in the long run, that growth has never been smooth. Sharp rises are often followed by painful declines, and investors who ignore history tend to repeat old mistakes.

He highlights the exceptional bull market from **1949 to 1968**, which created unrealistic expectations. Many investors began to believe that high returns were guaranteed. This mindset proved dangerous when the market declined sharply in **1969–1970**.

The chapter also explains how valuation metrics such as **price-to-earnings ratios and dividend yields** have changed over time. Stocks were cheap and yielded high dividends in earlier decades, while later periods showed higher prices and lower yields, making bonds relatively more attractive.

Graham emphasizes that **predicting market levels is extremely difficult**, even for experienced analysts. His own past evaluations were sometimes correct and sometimes overly cautious. This reinforces the idea that market timing is unreliable.

The core message of the chapter is clear:

* Don’t try to outsmart the market
* Avoid speculation disguised as investing
* Follow a **disciplined, long-term investment strategy**
* And when markets appear expensive, adopt a **conservative and cautious approach**
