# **COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 5**

Human felicity is produc’d not so much by great Pieces of good
Fortune that seldom happen, as by little Advantages that occur
every day.
                                            —Benjamin Franklin


## **THE BEST DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE**

---

## **Roman Urdu**

Pichhle kuch saalon ke stock-market crash ke baad yeh sawal bilkul natural hai ke koi defensive investor stocks mein paisa kyun lagaye. Graham yeh wazeh karta hai ke defensive hone ka matlab yeh nahi ke aap risk se darte ho, balkay yeh ke aap apni investment par **kitna time aur energy dena chahte ho**. Agar sahi tareeqe se invest kiya jaye, to stocks mein paisa lagana bonds ya cash jaisa hi simple ho sakta hai. Aaj ke daur mein index funds jaisi cheezen hain jo almost **automatic** tareeqe se kaam karti hain.

2000–2002 ke bear market ne bohot logon ko emotionally jala diya. Is wajah se bohot se investors ne decide kar liya ke woh dobara kabhi stocks nahi khareedenge. Turkish kahawat hai: *“Jab garam doodh se munh jal jaye, to banda dahi bhi phoonk kar khata hai.”* Lekin paradox yeh hai ke market ka itna gir jana hi asal mein **future risk ko kam** kar deta hai. Pehle stocks bohot mehngay thay (garam doodh), ab woh zyada realistic prices par hain (room-temperature dahi).

Logic ke mutabiq, aaj stocks rakhne ya na rakhne ka decision is baat par depend nahi karta ke aap ne past mein kitna loss kiya. Agar aaj stocks reasonable price par mil rahe hain aur future growth ka chance dete hain, to unhein rakhna chahiye — chahe past mein loss hua ho. Yeh baat aur bhi important ho jati hai jab bond yields bohot low hon, kyun ke phir bonds future mein strong returns nahi dete.

2003 ke aas-paas historical comparison se dekha jaye to stocks sirf thode se mehngay thay. Dusri taraf bonds itna kam return de rahe thay ke unhein “safe” samajhna aisa hi tha jaise koi smoker yeh soche ke low-tar cigarettes peene se cancer se bach jayega. Chahe aap kitne hi defensive kyun na hon, current valuations ka matlab yeh hai ke **stocks ko bilkul ignore nahi kiya ja sakta**.

Achhi baat yeh hai ke aaj defensive investor ke liye stocks mein invest karna pehle se bohot asaan ho chuka hai. Autopilot portfolios aur monthly investing plans investor ko yeh allow karte hain ke woh bina din-raat market dekhay, thoda thoda paisa har mahine invest karta rahe. Is tarah aap apni zindagi stock-picking mein waste kiye baghair bhi smart investor ban sakte ho.

After the severe stock-market crash of the early 2000s, it’s natural for a defensive investor to wonder why stocks should still be part of a portfolio. Graham reminds us that being “defensive” is not about fearing risk, but about how much time and effort you are willing to devote to managing investments. When done correctly, investing in stocks can be just as simple as holding bonds or cash, especially with tools like index funds that require almost no effort.

The bear market of 2000–2002 left many investors emotionally scarred, making them vow never to buy stocks again. As a Turkish proverb says, *“After burning your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.”* However, the irony is that a major market crash actually removes much of the risk from stocks. What was once overpriced and dangerous has now cooled down and become more reasonably valued.

From a rational perspective, today’s decision to own stocks should have nothing to do with losses suffered in the past. If stocks are reasonably priced and offer future growth potential, they deserve a place in your portfolio—regardless of previous declines. This is especially true when bond yields are low, limiting the future returns of supposedly “safe” investments.

By early 2003, stocks were only mildly overpriced by historical standards, while bonds offered extremely low yields. Buying bonds solely for safety was like a smoker believing that low-tar cigarettes prevent cancer. No matter how conservative or low-maintenance an investor wants to be, market conditions make it essential to keep at least some money in stocks.

The good news is that investing in stocks has never been easier for defensive investors. Automated portfolios and regular monthly investment plans allow investors to participate in the stock market without constant monitoring or stock picking. This approach lets your money grow steadily while freeing you from the burden of active management.

## **SHOULD YOU “BUY WHAT YOU KNOW”?**

---

## **Roman Urdu**

Sab se pehle defensive investor ko ek bohot khatarnaak soch se bachna hota hai: **yeh belief ke bina research kiye stocks pick kiye ja sakte hain**. 1980s aur early 1990s mein ek mashhoor investing slogan tha: *“Buy what you know.”* Is soch ke sab se bare supporter Peter Lynch thay, jinhon ne Fidelity Magellan fund ko history ka best mutual fund bana diya. Lynch ka kehna tha ke aam investors ke paas ek advantage hota hai — **common knowledge**. Agar aap kisi restaurant, product, ya company ko personally use karte ho, ya notice karte ho ke uska business bohot busy hai, to shayad aap Wall Street se pehle uski potential samajh sakte ho.

Lekin Lynch ka rule sirf tab kaam karta hai jab uska **second rule bhi follow kiya jaye** — aur woh hai proper research. Lynch khud kehta hai ke sirf product pasand hone ki wajah se stock nahi khareedna chahiye. Company ke **financial statements, profits, aur business value** ko analyze karna lazmi hai. Problem yeh hui ke zyada tar investors ne Lynch ki baat ka sirf pehla hissa suna, doosra ignore kar diya.

Is ghalat soch ki ek famous example Barbra Streisand hai, jinhon ne 1999 mein kaha: *“Hum roz Starbucks jate hain, is liye main Starbucks ka stock khareedti hoon.”* Yeh soch bohot logon ne adopt ki — Amazon ka stock sirf website pasand hone ki wajah se, ya e*Trade ka stock kyun ke woh unka broker tha. Log yeh bhool gaye ke **achi company bhi mehngi price par buri investment ban sakti hai**.

Is soch ko aur zyada strength tab mili jab “experts” ne bhi isey promote kiya. 1999 mein CNN par ek fund manager ne kaha ke agar aap apni industry ke qareeb raho aur logon se baat karte raho, to aap bhi market beat kar sakte ho. Yeh baat sunne mein achi lagti hai, lekin defensive investor ke liye yeh approach bohot dangerous ho sakti hai.

Is rule ka sab se painful misuse **corporate retirement plans (401k)** mein hua. Logon ne yeh socha ke apni company ka stock sab se safe hoga kyun ke woh wahan kaam karte hain. Enron, WorldCom aur Global Crossing jaise cases ne yeh prove kar diya ke **andar ka banda bhi aksar sirf illusion of knowledge rakhta hai**, real knowledge nahi. Jab company doobti hai, to job bhi jati hai aur retirement bhi.

Psychology research yeh batati hai ke jab insan kisi cheez se zyada familiar hota hai, to woh apni knowledge ko **overestimate** karta hai. Is problem ko *home bias* kehte hain — matlab jo cheez apni lagti hai, usi par zyada bharosa karna. Isi liye log apni local companies, apni city ke stocks, aur apni company ke shares hadd se zyada rakh lete hain.

Short mein, **familiar cheez insan ko careless bana deti hai**. Jaise crime news mein aksar padosi kehte hain: *“Woh to bohot acha insaan lagta tha.”* Kyun? Kyun ke qareebi cheezon ko hum question nahi karte. Stock market mein bhi yehi hota hai. Jitna zyada stock familiar lagta hai, utna hi defensive investor lazy ho jata hai aur homework chhor deta hai. **Aap ko aisa nahi hone dena.**

The first danger a defensive investor must guard against is the belief that stocks can be picked without doing any homework. During the 1980s and early 1990s, a popular investing slogan was “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch, who ran Fidelity Magellan with extraordinary success, strongly promoted this idea. He argued that ordinary investors have an edge called “common knowledge.” If you notice a popular product, a crowded store, or a busy company, you might spot an opportunity before Wall Street does.

However, Lynch’s idea works only if its second rule is followed: **research must come next**. Lynch himself insisted that no one should invest in a company—no matter how great its products seem—without carefully studying its financial statements and estimating its true business value. Unfortunately, most investors ignored this crucial step.

A well-known example of this mistake came in 1999 when Barbra Streisand said she bought Starbucks stock simply because she went there every day. Many investors made the same error, buying Amazon because they liked the website or e*Trade because it was their broker. They forgot that even a great company can be a terrible investment if the stock price is too high.

The idea gained even more credibility when experts reinforced it. In a 1999 CNN interview, a successful fund manager suggested that anyone could succeed by sticking close to industries they knew well. While appealing, this approach can be dangerous for defensive investors.

The most painful misuse of “buy what you know” occurred in corporate retirement plans. Many employees invested heavily in their own company’s stock, believing they understood the business better than outsiders. Employees of Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing learned the hard way that insiders often have **the illusion of knowledge**, not real insight.

Psychological research shows that familiarity actually increases overconfidence. This phenomenon, called *home bias*, causes investors to favor what feels familiar—local companies, nearby headquarters, or their own employer’s stock. As a result, investors fail to question risks objectively.

In short, familiarity breeds complacency. Just as neighbors are shocked when a “nice guy” turns out to be a criminal, investors often fail to question familiar stocks. The more familiar a stock feels, the more likely a defensive investor is to skip research. **Don’t let familiarity turn you into a lazy investor.**

## **Roman Urdu**

Defensive investor ke liye yeh waqai **Golden Age** hai. History mein pehli dafa stocks own karna itna **sasta, asaan aur convenient** ho gaya hai. Agar aap basic homework karne ko tayar ho, to aaj portfolio banana kisi mushkil kaam jaisa nahi raha. Internet ne investing ko aam aadmi ke liye bhi possible bana diya hai, chahe aap ke paas invest karne ke liye bohot kam paisa hi kyun na ho.

Aaj aap **online brokerages** ke zariye khud stocks khareed sakte ho. Aisi websites maujood hain jahan aap weekly ya monthly thoda thoda invest kar sakte ho, dividends automatically reinvest karwa sakte ho, aur bank account ya salary se direct paisa stocks mein dalwa sakte ho. Minimum balance ki koi condition nahi hoti, is liye beginners ke liye yeh system perfect hai. Haan, agar aap bohot chhoti amount invest kar rahe ho, to transaction fee ka percentage zyada lag sakta hai — lekin phir bhi diversification shuru karne ka yeh best tareeqa hota hai.

Ek aur option yeh hai ke aap **direct companies se stocks khareedo**, bina broker ke. SEC ke rules relax hone ke baad bohot si companies ne direct stock purchase plans shuru kiye. Is tareeqe mein kuch chhoti chhoti fees hoti hain, lekin overall yeh traditional brokers se sasta hota hai. Lekin yahan ek warning zaroori hai: agar aap saalon tak chhoti chhoti quantities mein stocks khareedte rahoge, to **tax record rakhna bohot mushkil** ho sakta hai. Agar aap detailed records maintain nahi kar sakte, to yeh tareeqa avoid karo.

Defensive investor ke liye sab se badi ghalti yeh hai ke woh **sirf ek ya do stocks** mein paisa laga de. Agar aap diversification nahi kar sakte, to behtar hai invest hi na karo. Graham ka rule aaj bhi valid hai: **10 se 30 stocks** ka portfolio ek achi starting point hai. Is ke sath yeh bhi zaroori hai ke aap ek hi industry mein zyada exposure na le lo.

Autopilot portfolio ka matlab yeh nahi ke aap har waqt trading karo. Agar aap saal mein do dafa se zyada trade kar rahe ho, ya har mahine ek do ghantay se zyada investments par time laga rahe ho, to iska matlab kuch ghalat ho raha hai. Internet ki speed aur excitement aap ko speculator bana sakti hai. Defensive investor ka formula simple hai: **kam harkat, zyada sabr, aur long-term focus**.

Agar aap khud stocks select nahi karna chahte, to aap **help bhi le sakte ho** — discount broker, financial planner, ya full-service broker se. Lekin ek zimmedari kabhi outsource nahi karni chahiye: **advisor ki honesty aur fees ka proper check**. Paisa dene se pehle yeh confirm karna sirf aap ka kaam hai.

Aakhri aur sab se asaan option **mutual funds**, khas taur par **index funds**, hain. Yeh defensive investor ke liye almost perfect solution hain. Low cost, high diversification, aur zero tension. Index funds aise investment hain jinhein aap saalon tak bhool bhi jao, to bhi system kaam karta rehta hai. Isi liye index funds ko defensive investor ka **dream investment** kaha jata hai.

For a defensive investor, this truly is a Golden Age. Never before has owning stocks been so cheap, easy, and convenient. If you are willing to do basic homework, building a stock portfolio today is far simpler than it was in the past—even if you have very little money to invest.

Online brokerages now allow investors to buy stocks automatically on a weekly or monthly basis, reinvest dividends, and invest directly from bank accounts or paychecks. These platforms often have no minimum balance requirements, making them ideal for beginners who want to build portfolios on autopilot. Although small investments may suffer higher percentage fees, these services remain one of the few practical ways to build a diversified portfolio with limited cash.

Another option is buying stocks directly from companies through direct stock purchase plans. After regulatory changes in the 1990s, many companies began offering these programs. While they may include small nuisance fees, they are usually cheaper than traditional brokers. However, frequent small purchases can create tax record-keeping challenges. If you are not willing to maintain detailed records, you should avoid this approach.

A defensive investor should never concentrate money in just one or two stocks. Diversification is essential. Graham’s guideline of owning **10 to 30 stocks** remains a sensible starting point, provided exposure is spread across industries.

Once an autopilot portfolio is set up, trading should be minimal. If you find yourself trading more than twice a year or spending more than a couple of hours per month on your investments, something has gone wrong. The ease of online trading can tempt investors into speculation. A defensive investor succeeds by staying patient and inactive.

For those who prefer assistance, stocks can also be owned through discount brokers, financial planners, or full-service brokers. While professionals can help with selection, one responsibility must never be delegated: verifying that an adviser is honest and charges reasonable fees.

Finally, mutual funds—especially **index funds**—offer the simplest solution. They provide diversification, low cost, and minimal maintenance. Index funds require so little attention that they can be held for decades without worry. For defensive investors, they represent an almost ideal investment choice.

## **FILLING IN THE POTHOLES**

## **Roman Urdu**

Financial markets roz up aur down ho rahe hain, lekin defensive investor is **chaos ko control kar sakta hai**. Sab se badi taqat yeh hai ke aap **apni activity aur future predict karne ki illusion se inkaar karte ho**. Jab aap har investment decision autopilot par dal dete ho, to aap market ke fluctuations se emotionally disturb nahi hote.

Graham ke mutabiq, **dollar-cost averaging** ek simple formula hai: aap har week, month, ya quarter ek fixed amount invest karte ho. Chahe market upar jaaye, neeche jaaye ya sideways rahe, aap hamesha invest karte rehte ho. Mutual funds aur brokerages yeh kaam automatically aur safely kar sakte hain, aapko check likhne ki ya payment ke stress ki zarurat nahi hoti.

Ideal hai ke dollar-cost averaging **index funds** mein ho. Index funds har stock ya bond hold karte hain jo worth having hain. Is se aap guesswork aur speculation dono se bach jate ho — na sirf market ka, balki sectors aur individual stocks ka bhi.

Agar aap $500 per month invest kar sakte ho, to example ke liye: $300 U.S. stock market index fund, $100 foreign stocks fund, aur $100 U.S. bonds fund mein dal do. Har mahine ye investment automatic ho jaye. Agar market gir gaya, to aapka paisa zyada shares khareedta hai; agar upar gaya, to kam shares khareedta hai. Is se aap emotionally react nahi karte — na market ko chase karte ho jab sab se dangerous lag raha ho, na panic buy ya avoid karte ho crash ke baad.

History bhi is approach ko support karti hai. Agar 1929 mein aap $12,000 ek single S&P 500 investment mein dalte, to 10 saal baad sirf $7,223 bacha hota. Lekin agar $100 se shuru karte aur har mahine $100 invest karte, to August 1939 tak $15,571 ho jata! Yeh disciplined buying ka power hai, chahe market worst bear phase mein ho.

Autopilot portfolio ka sab se bada faida yeh hai ke aap **har market question ka jawab simple de sakte ho: “I don’t know and I don’t care.”** Bonds vs stocks? I don’t know and I don’t care — dono automatic buy ho rahe hain. Healthcare ya tech? Microsoft ka next? Foreign stocks next year outperform karenge? Sab ka jawab wahi hai.

Yeh attitude, ke **aapko future predict karne ki zarurat nahi**, defensive investor ka sab se powerful weapon hai. Apni ignorance ko accept karna aur discipline ke saath autopilot investing karna hi long-term success ka raaz hai.

As financial markets fluctuate wildly every day, a defensive investor can take control of the chaos. The key is **refusing to be active and renouncing any illusion of predicting the future**. By putting all investment decisions on autopilot, you remove the market’s power to emotionally upset you.

Graham calls this **dollar-cost averaging**: invest a fixed amount every week, month, or quarter, regardless of whether the market goes up, down, or sideways. Major mutual funds or brokerages can automatically handle this electronically, removing the stress of writing checks or timing the market.

The ideal approach is to dollar-cost average into **index funds**, which hold nearly every worthwhile stock or bond. This eliminates the need to guess which sectors or individual securities will perform best.

For example, if you can invest $500 per month: $300 into a total U.S. stock market index fund, $100 into a foreign stock fund, and $100 into a U.S. bond fund. Each month, your money buys more shares if the market is down and fewer if it is up, preventing emotional mistakes like chasing a rising market or avoiding investments after a crash.

History confirms the power of this approach. If you invested $12,000 in the S&P 500 at the start of September 1929, ten years later you would have only $7,223. But if you started with $100 and added $100 each month, by August 1939 you would have $15,571. This shows the strength of disciplined investing, even during the worst bear markets.

The greatest advantage of an autopilot portfolio is that you can respond to any market question with **“I don’t know and I don’t care.”** Will bonds outperform stocks? I don’t know and I don’t care — you’re automatically buying both. Healthcare vs tech? Microsoft’s next big hit? Foreign stocks outperforming next year? All automatically included.

By accepting that you **cannot predict the future**, a defensive investor leverages one of the most powerful weapons: discipline, consistency, and peace of mind in the face of market uncertainty.
