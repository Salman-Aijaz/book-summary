# **The Intelligent Investor – General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor**

---

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Is chapter mein Graham defensive investors ko guide karte hain ke woh apna portfolio kaise design karein taake **capital safe rahe aur stress kam ho**. Defensive investor ka maksad hai high returns chase karna nahi, balke **safety aur steady income** ensure karna.

Graham ke mutabiq, **portfolio ko high-grade bonds aur high-grade common stocks** mein divide karna sab se practical approach hai. Stocks ka hissa **25% se kam aur 75% se zyada** nahi hona chahiye, aur ideal **50–50 allocation** hai. Market ke upar ya neeche jaane par **rebalance karo**: stocks 55% ho jaye → thoda becho, 45% ho → thoda khareedo. Ye simple strategy **discipline aur risk control** sikhaati hai.

Bonds select karte waqt investor ko **taxable vs tax-free** aur **short vs long-term** decide karna hota hai. Short-term bonds kam risky aur kam return dete hain; long-term bonds zyada return dete hain lekin interest rate ke changes se sensitive hote hain. U.S. Savings Bonds beginners ke liye **safe aur flexible** option hain, ~5% guaranteed return ke sath.

High-yield (low-quality) bonds aur **callable bonds** average defensive investor ke liye risky hain. Callable bonds unfair hote hain — agar interest rates girte ya barhte hain, investor ka nuksan aur company ka faida hota hai. Graham advice deta hai: **non-callable, long-term, low-coupon bonds** lena zyada safe hai.

Preferred stocks structurally weak hote hain: safety depend karti hai **company ke common dividends** par aur fixed dividend ke alawa koi upside nahi. Defensive investors ko sirf **bargain prices** par khareedna chahiye; otherwise bonds better option hain. Corporations ke liye tax-wise advantage hota hai, individuals ke liye nahi.

Chapter ka core lesson yeh hai: **defensive investing mein safety, discipline aur intelligent effort sab se important hai**, aur high-risk chasing ya market timing se bacha jaaye.

## **Summary in English**

In this chapter, Graham guides defensive investors on designing a portfolio to **protect capital and minimize stress**. The goal is not to chase high returns but to maintain **safety and steady income**.

He recommends dividing the portfolio between **high-grade bonds and high-grade common stocks**. Stocks should constitute **25–75%**, with **50–50** as the ideal allocation. Investors should **rebalance** periodically: if stocks rise above 55% → sell some, if they fall below 45% → buy more. This approach promotes **discipline and risk control**.

When selecting bonds, investors must decide **taxable vs tax-free** and **short vs long-term**. Short-term bonds are safer but yield less, while long-term bonds offer higher returns but are more sensitive to interest-rate changes. **U.S. Savings Bonds** are a safe, flexible option for smaller investors, offering ~5% guaranteed return.

High-yield (low-quality) and **callable bonds** are generally risky for defensive investors. Callable bonds are “unfair”: interest rate changes can disadvantage investors. Graham advises **non-callable, long-term, low-coupon bonds** for safety.

Preferred stocks are structurally weaker: safety depends on **common stock dividends**, and they offer no upside beyond a fixed dividend. Defensive investors should only buy at **bargain prices**; otherwise, bonds are better. Corporations gain tax benefits, individuals do not.

The chapter’s core message: **defensive investing requires safety, discipline, and intelligent effort**, avoiding high-risk speculation and market timing.
