# **Inflation – Commentary Summary**

Americans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two
people to carry ten dollars’ worth of groceries. Today, a fiveyear-old can do it.

## ✅ **Roman Urdu Summary**

Is commentary ka bunyadi maqsad yeh batana hai ke inflation ko log aksar **ignore kar dete hain**, jab ke asal mein yeh investor ke liye ek **khamosh lekin khatarnaak dushman** hoti hai. 1997 se 2002 ke darmiyan inflation bohot kam rahi — lagbhag 1% se 2% ke beech — jis ki wajah se kai log yeh kehne lage ke “inflation mar chuki hai.” Technology aur better-quality products ki wajah se mehngai kam mehsoos hoti rahi, is liye investors ne is risk ko nazarandaz kar diya.

Is ghalat soch ki ek wajah **“money illusion”** hai. Insaan nominal numbers ko zyada importance deta hai. Agar salary ya return number mein barh jaye, to hum khush ho jate hain, chahe inflation ke baad asal value kam ho chuki ho. Isi tarah log 1980 mein 11% CDs par khush thay jab ke asal mein inflation unka paisa kha rahi thi, aur 2003 mein sirf 2% par mayoos thay jab ke inflation ke baad wo behtar position mein thay. Inflation chhup kar daulat kam karti hai, is liye usey samajhna mushkil hota hai.

Commentary yeh bhi wazeh karti hai ke inflation bilkul khatam nahi hui. 1973 se 1982 ke darmiyan America ne bohot sakht inflation dekhi, jahan prices double ho gaye aur dollar ki value aadhi se bhi kam reh gayi. Duniya ke zyada tar mulkon mein kabhi na kabhi bohot zyada inflation aa chuki hai. Is ke ilawa governments ka apna faida hota hai ke thori inflation rahe, kyun ke woh apna qarza kam value ke paison se chuka sakti hain. Is liye inflation ke dobara aane ka risk hamesha maujood rehta hai.

Aam mashwara hota hai ke inflation se bachne ke liye **stocks khareedo**, lekin commentary batati hai ke yeh poori tarah sahi nahi. History dikhati hai ke bohot zyada inflation ke dauran stocks bhi buri performance dete hain. Haan, long term mein stocks aksar inflation ko beat kar jate hain, lekin har dafa nahi — lagbhag 20% waqt aisa hota hai jab stocks inflation se peeche reh jate hain.

Is liye intelligent investor sirf stocks par depend nahi karta. Commentary do important tools introduce karti hai. Pehla **REITs** hain — real estate companies jo rental income leti hain aur inflation ke khilaf kuch had tak protection deti hain. Doosra aur zyada reliable option **TIPS** hain — government bonds jo inflation ke sath sath apni value barhate hain. TIPS default se mehfooz hoti hain aur purchasing power ko protect karti hain, lekin tax ki wajah se inhein retirement accounts mein rakhna behtar hota hai.

Aakhri lesson yeh hai ke inflation se bachao ke liye **balance aur planning** zaroori hai. TIPS ko long-term hold ke taur par rakhna chahiye, trading ke liye nahi. Aam investor ke liye apne retirement assets ka kuch hissa — misal ke taur par 10% — TIPS mein rakhna ek smart aur safe strategy hai, jo paisay ko inflation ke “khamosh panjon” se mehfooz rakhti hai.

## ✅ **English Summary**

This commentary explains why inflation is often **ignored by investors**, even though it is one of the most **dangerous long-term risks** to wealth. From 1997 to 2002, inflation in the U.S. was very low—around 1% to 2%—leading many commentators to declare that “inflation is dead.” Falling prices of technology and improved product quality made inflation seem even less threatening.

One major reason investors underestimate inflation is the **“money illusion.”** People focus on nominal gains rather than real, after-inflation results. A positive number feels good even if purchasing power declines. That’s why investors were happy earning 11% on CDs in 1980 despite losing money after inflation, and disappointed with 2% returns in 2003 even though inflation was lower. Inflation quietly erodes wealth, making it easy to overlook.

The commentary stresses that inflation is far from dead. Between 1973 and 1982, U.S. prices more than doubled, cutting the value of the dollar by more than half. Many countries around the world have experienced extreme inflation, and governments often have an incentive to allow inflation since it reduces the real burden of public debt. Ignoring this risk would be reckless.

Although stocks are commonly viewed as the best inflation hedge, the evidence shows they are only a **partial solution**. Stocks perform poorly during deflation and during periods of very high inflation. Historically, stocks have beaten inflation most of the time, but they still fail to do so in roughly one out of five periods.

To strengthen inflation protection, the commentary recommends going beyond stocks. **REITs** (Real Estate Investment Trusts) provide some defense against inflation through rental income and property values. Even more effective are **TIPS** (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), government bonds whose value rises with inflation and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

TIPS are best held in tax-deferred retirement accounts because their inflation adjustments are taxable. They should not be traded but held permanently as a stable, long-term asset. For most investors, allocating around **10% of retirement assets to TIPS** is a prudent way to protect purchasing power and keep part of their wealth completely safe from inflation.
