## **JUNKYAR  DOGS?**

---

### **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Graham ke mutabiq high-yield bonds, jo aaj kal “junk bonds” kehlate hain, aam investors ke liye risky aur complicated hain. Pehle individual investor ke liye unka risk diversify karna mushkil tha. Aaj 130 se zyada mutual funds junk bonds mein invest karte hain aur kai bonds kharid kar risk ko thoda kam karte hain. Phir bhi, Graham high-yield preferred stocks ke liye ab bhi negative hai, kyunki unka risk spread karna sasta ya easy nahi. 1978 ke baad, har saal average 4.4% junk bonds default karte rahe, magar fir bhi unka annual return 10.5% raha, jab ke 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds ka 8.6% tha. Lekin zyada junk-bond funds high fees lete hain aur principal protect nahi karte. Ye fund sirf un logon ke liye suitable hai jo retire ho chuke hain, extra monthly income chahte hain aur temporary losses tolerate kar sakte hain. Agar aap financial sector mein kaam karte hain, to junk-bond fund interest rate rise ke dauran 401(k) ko balance karne ka ek minor option ho sakta hai. Overall, ye ek zaroori investment nahi, sirf ek optional tool hai intelligent investors ke liye.

### **Summary in English**

According to Graham, high-yield bonds, now called “junk bonds,” are risky and complicated for individual investors. In his time, it was hard to diversify their risks. Today, over 130 mutual funds buy many junk bonds to reduce risk. Still, Graham stays cautious about high-yield preferred stocks, as their risk cannot be easily spread. Since 1978, an average of 4.4% of junk bonds defaulted annually, yet their annual return has been 10.5%, compared to 8.6% for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Many junk-bond funds charge high fees and don’t fully protect your principal. These funds may suit retirees seeking extra income and who can tolerate temporary drops in value. For financial-sector workers, a junk-bond fund might act as a minor counterbalance in a 401(k) during rising interest rates. Overall, it is optional, not essential, for intelligent investors.

## **A WORLD OF HURT FOR WORLDCOM BONDS**

---

### **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Sirf bond ki high yield ke liye usay kharidna, bilkul us tarah hai jaise sirf sex ke liye shaadi karna. Agar jo cheez pehle attract kar rahi thi wo khatam ho jaye, to aakhir mein sirf heartbreak bachta hai.

May 2001 mein, WorldCom ne U.S. history ka sabse bada bond issue kiya—$11.9 billion ka. Badi badi pension funds aur bond funds, high yields (8.3% tak) dekh kar attract ho gaye. Lekin agar unhone sirf bond ka prospectus dekha hota, to pata chal jata ke WorldCom ke paas sirf high yield tha aur sab kuch lose hone ka risk tha. Company apni purani profits se interest cover nahi kar pa rahi thi aur naye bonds ke saath interest cost $900 million aur badh gaya tha.

Kuch mahino ke liye yields achhe lage, lekin jaise Graham predict karte, ye safety provide nahi kar saki.

* July 2002 mein WorldCom ne **bankruptcy file** ki.
* August 2002 mein company ne admit kiya ke usne **$7 billion earnings overstated** kiye the.

High yield kabhi bhi aise explosive risk ka compensation nahi de sakti.

### **Summary in English**

Buying a bond just for its yield is like marrying only for sex—once the attraction is gone, you’re left with heartbreak.

In May 2001, WorldCom issued the largest corporate bond in U.S. history—$11.9 billion. Big pension funds and bond funds were drawn by high yields of up to 8.3%. But even a quick glance at the bond prospectus would have shown that WorldCom had nothing but yield to offer and huge risks. The company’s past profits couldn’t cover interest, and the new bonds increased annual interest costs by $900 million.

The bonds produced high yields for a few months, but, as Graham would have predicted, the yields offered no protection:

* WorldCom filed **bankruptcy in July 2002**.
* In August 2002, it admitted it had **overstated earnings by over $7 billion**.

No yield can ever compensate an investor for such explosive risk.

## **THE VODKA-AND-BURRITO PORTFOLIO**

---

### **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Graham ke mutabiq foreign bonds bhi junk bonds jaisi risky investment hain. Aaj kuch foreign bonds un investors ke liye interesting ho sakte hain jo high risk tolerate kar sakte hain. Kuch mutual funds specially emerging-market countries jaise Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, aur Venezuela ke bonds mein invest karte hain. Ek sensible investor apni total bond portfolio ka 10% se zyada isme nahi lagata. Magar ye funds aksar U.S. stock market ke saath sync nahi karte, isliye agar Dow gir jaye, ye bonds aksar down nahi hote. Ye thodi security aur comfort provide karte hain portfolio mein, jab zarurat ho.

### **Summary in English**

Graham considered foreign bonds just as risky as junk bonds. Today, some foreign bonds may appeal to investors willing to take high risk. A few mutual funds focus on bonds from emerging-market countries like Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, and Venezuela. No sensible investor would put more than 10% of their total bond portfolio in these risky holdings. However, these funds rarely move in sync with the U.S. stock market, so if the Dow falls, they often don’t. This can give investors a small measure of comfort in their portfolio when they need it most.

## **DYING A TRADER’S DEATH**

---

### **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Chapter 1 mein dekha gaya ke **day trading**—sirf kuch hours ke liye stocks rakhna—financial suicide karne ka best tareeqa hai. Kabhi kabhi aap profit kama lete hain, lekin zyada tar trades lose hoti hain, aur broker hamesha paisa kamata hai.

Aapki jaldi aur eagerness bhi returns ko kam kar deti hai. Agar aap kisi stock ko zarurat se zyada jaldi kharidte hain, to price thoda upar chala jata hai aur aap ka invisible loss ho jata hai. Market impact aur trading costs—jo 2–4% (buy ya sell) ya 4–8% (round-trip) ho sakte hain—apke returns ko directly ghata dete hain. Agar aap $1,000 invest karte hain, to shuru se hi $40 costs khatam kar deti hain.

Day trading long-term gains ko ordinary income mein convert kar deta hai, jisse zyada tax lagta hai (20% vs 38.6%). Matlab, ek trader ko kam se kam 10% gain karna padta hai sirf break-even ke liye.

UC Berkeley ke professors ne 66,000 traders ka study kiya: jo log zyada trade karte the (20% monthly), wo market se **6.4% per year underperform kar gaye**. Jo log patience se invest karte the (0.2% monthly), wo market ko beat kar gaye aur apna zyada paisa rakha.

**Lesson:** Jaldi mein trading mat karo. Long-term investing hi sahi aur safe approach hai. Jo log stocks kuch mahino se zyada hold nahi kar sakte, wo hamesha victim ban kar rahenge.

### **Summary in English**

As we saw in Chapter 1, **day trading**—holding stocks for just a few hours—is a fast way to lose money. Sometimes you may profit, but most trades lose, and your broker always earns.

Your eagerness to buy or sell also lowers your returns. Buying too quickly can raise the stock price slightly, creating invisible losses. Trading costs—2–4% per buy or sell, or 4–8% round-trip—erode profits. For $1,000 invested, you may lose $40 before you even start.

Day trading also turns long-term gains into ordinary income, increasing taxes (20% vs 38.6%). A trader needs at least 10% gain just to break even.

A UC Berkeley study of 66,000 traders found that the most active traders (shifting 20% of holdings monthly) **underperformed the market by 6.4% per year**, while patient investors (trading only 0.2% monthly) beat the market and kept almost all their gains.

**Lesson:** Don’t trade obsessively. Long-term investing is the only safe approach. Anyone who can’t hold stocks for years is destined to be a loser, not a winner.

## **THE EARLY BIRD GET'S WORMED**

---

### **Summary in Roman Urdu**

1990s mein investors ke zehan mein ek zehar tha: “IPOs se jaldi ameer ho jao.” IPO, yaani **initial public offering**, ek company ka pehli baar stocks public ko bechna hai. Shuru mein ye idea attractive lagta hai—jaise Microsoft ka IPO 1986 mein agar aapne kharida hota, to 2003 tak $2,100 se $720,000 ban jata.

Magar har IPO Microsoft jaisa hit nahi hota. Zyada tar IPOs fail hote hain. Log **“next Microsoft”** dhoondte hain, lekin psychology ke mutabiq hum vivid examples ko overestimate kar lete hain aur majority ke failures ignore kar dete hain. Realistic taur par IPOs ke high returns aksar **exclusive insiders—investment banks aur fund houses** ke liye reserved hote hain, individual investors ke liye nahi.

VA Linux ka example clear hai. IPO price $30 tha, magar demand itni zyada ke opening day hi $239 per chala gaya—a gain sirf few institutions ko mila. Company khud **loss-making** thi: sales $44 million, losses $30 million. Teen saal baad, stock $1.19 per share par tha.

Graham ke rule ke mutabiq: stock kharido sirf agar wo **achha business cheap price mein** offer karta ho. Popularity ya hype ke liye kharidna **galat aur risky** hai. IPO ka matlab sirf “initial public offering” nahi—ye shayad ye bhi ho sakta hai: “It’s Probably Overpriced, Imaginary Profits Only, Insiders’ Private Opportunity, or Idiotic, Preposterous, and Outrageous.”

### **Summary in English**

In the 1990s, one of the most dangerous ideas was that you could get rich quickly from IPOs—**initial public offerings**, when a company sells its stock to the public for the first time. At first glance, it seems tempting: if you bought Microsoft’s IPO in 1986, $2,100 could have grown to $720,000 by 2003.

But for every Microsoft, there are thousands of losers. People chase “the next Microsoft” because vivid past examples bias their judgment, ignoring that most IPOs fail. High returns usually go to **insiders—investment banks and funds**—not individual investors.

VA Linux shows the danger. IPO price was $30, but demand pushed it to $239 on day one—profits went mostly to institutions. The company itself was losing money, and three years later, the stock fell to $1.19.

According to Graham, you should buy stocks **only if they are good businesses at a reasonable price**. Popularity and hype are no substitute for value. IPO, therefore, is not just “initial public offering”—it can also mean: “It’s Probably Overpriced, Imaginary Profits Only, Insiders’ Private Opportunity, or Idiotic, Preposterous, and Outrageous.”
