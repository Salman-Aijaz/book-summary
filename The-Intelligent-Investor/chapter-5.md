# 📘 **Chapter Summary (Roman Urdu)**

### **Common Stocks ki Investment Value**

Is chapter mein yeh bataya gaya hai ke common stocks ko historically risky samjha jata tha, lekin long-term mein yeh **inflation se protection** aur **higher returns** dete aaye hain. Lekin agar shares **bohot zyada mehngay price** par khareede jayein, to yeh faida khatam ho jata hai.

Defensive investor ke liye common stocks zaroori hain, chahe woh “lesser evil” hi kyun na hon — kyun ke sirf bonds par depend karna bhi risk se khaali nahi.

### **Defensive Investor ke liye Common Stocks ke 4 Rules**

1. **Diversification zaroori hai**, lekin hadd se zyada nahi
   (10 se 30 companies ka portfolio).
2. **Companies bari, well-known aur financially strong honi chahiyein.**
3. **Lambi dividend history honi chahiye**, kam az kam 1950 se lagataar dividends.
4. **Price limit follow karo**

   * 7 saal ke average earnings ka 25× se zyada price nahi
   * Last 12 months earnings ka 20× se zyada nahi

---

### **Growth Stocks aur Defensive Investor**

Growth stocks attractive lagti hain, lekin aam tor par **bohot mehngi hoti hain** aur unmein **speculation ka risk** hota hai.
IBM aur Texas Instruments jaise examples dikhate hain ke best companies bhi **50–80% tak gir sakti hain**.

Is liye **defensive investor ke liye growth stocks suitable nahi**, jab tak investor bohot experienced na ho.

---

### **Portfolio Changes**

Portfolio ko saal mein ek dafa review karna chahiye, lekin:

* Frequent trading se bacho
* Advisor ko clearly batao ke **4 basic rules follow karni hain**
* Agar starting mein selection theek ho, to zyada changes ki zarurat nahi hoti

---

### **Dollar-Cost Averaging**

Har month ya har saal **fixed amount invest karna** (price upar ho ya neeche) ek bohot powerful strategy hai.
History dikhati hai ke long-term mein yeh strategy **almost hamesha profit** deti hai, chahe market short-term mein gir jaye.

---

### **Investor ki Personal Situation**

* **Widow** → Capital protection sab se important, speculation se door rehna
* **Doctor (mid-career)** → Defensive ya enterprising dono ho sakta hai, lekin time ki kami ek risk hai
* **Young saver** → Simple defensive strategy best hai; learning ke liye chhoti amounts se experiment kar sakta hai

---

### **Risk ka Real Meaning**

Price ka temporary girna **real risk nahi**.
Real risk tab hota hai jab:

* Company financially weak ho jaye
* Ya investor ne **intrinsic value se bohot zyada price pay ki ho**

Market fluctuation ko risk samajhna **mental mistake** hai.

---

### **Large, Prominent & Conservatively Financed Companies**

* Industrial company mein **common equity ≥ 50%** honi chahiye
* Utility/railroad ke liye **≥ 30%**
* Company industry ki top 25–30% mein honi chahiye

Exact numbers rigid nahi hain, **common sense zyada important hai**.

---

### **Final Core Message**

Investment ka success paison se nahi, balkay:

* **Knowledge**
* **Experience**
* **Temperament**

par depend karta hai.
Defensive investor ka goal **market ko beat karna nahi**, balkay **long-term safety aur steady returns** hota hai.

# 📘 **Chapter Summary (English)**

### **Investment Merits of Common Stocks**

This chapter explains that although common stocks were once viewed as speculative, over the long term they have provided:

* Protection against inflation
* Higher average returns than bonds

However, these benefits disappear if stocks are purchased at **excessively high prices**. For the defensive investor, common stocks are necessary—even if they are considered the “lesser evil” compared to an all-bond portfolio.

---

### **Four Rules for the Defensive Investor**

1. **Adequate diversification**, but not excessive (10–30 stocks).
2. **Large, well-known, and conservatively financed companies.**
3. **Long record of continuous dividend payments** (at least since 1950).
4. **Reasonable price limits**

   * No more than 25× average earnings of past 7 years
   * No more than 20× last 12 months’ earnings

---

### **Growth Stocks and Risk**

Growth stocks often sell at very high valuations, which introduces heavy speculation. Even top-quality growth stocks like IBM or Texas Instruments have suffered massive price declines.

Therefore, **growth stocks are not suitable for defensive investors**.

---

### **Portfolio Review**

Periodic review is sensible, but frequent changes are unnecessary if the portfolio was well selected initially. Any advisor should strictly follow the defensive rules.

---

### **Dollar-Cost Averaging**

Investing a fixed amount at regular intervals reduces timing risk. Historical evidence shows that dollar-cost averaging has produced profits over long periods regardless of market conditions.

---

### **Investor’s Personal Situation**

* **Widow**: Must prioritize safety and avoid speculation.
* **Doctor**: Similar choices, but limited time is a disadvantage.
* **Young saver**: Defensive strategy is logical; small-scale learning is acceptable.

---

### **True Meaning of Risk**

Temporary market price declines do not constitute real risk.
Real risk arises from:

* Deterioration in the company’s fundamentals
* Paying too high a price relative to intrinsic value

---

### **Large and Conservative Companies**

* Industrials: Common equity ≥ 50% of total capitalization
* Utilities/Railroads: ≥ 30%
* Companies should be industry leaders

Exact rules are guides, not rigid laws.

---

### **Core Philosophy**

Investment success depends not on wealth, but on:

* Knowledge
* Experience
* Temperament

The defensive investor seeks **safety and satisfactory returns**, not to outperform the market.
