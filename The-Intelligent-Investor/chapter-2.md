# **The Intelligent Investor – Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation**

---

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Is chapter mein Benjamin Graham inflation (mehngai) ke hawalay se investors ki soch aur us se judi ghalat fehmiyon ko challenge karte hain. Jab currency ki purchasing power girti hai, to investors naturally pareshan ho jate hain aur apni strategy ko inflation ke darr par dobara design karne lagte hain. Graham yahan yeh wazeh karte hain ke inflation ko ignore karna ghalat hai, lekin us se panic mein aakar extreme decisions lena us se bhi zyada khatarnaak hai.

Aam tor par yeh samjha jata hai ke inflation ka sab se zyada nuksan bonds ko hota hai, kyun ke unki income aur principal fixed hoti hai. Is ke baraks stocks ke hawalay se yeh tasur diya jata hai ke companies apni prices barha kar inflation ka asar customers par daal deti hain, jis se unki earnings aur share prices barh jati hain. Isi soch ne logon ko yeh maan lene par majboor kar diya ke bonds hamesha buri investment hain aur stocks hamesha behtar. Graham is soch ko seedha seedha ghalat qarar dete hain. Un ke mutabiq, koi bhi investment na hamesha achi hoti hai aur na hamesha buri — asal faisla price aur overall conditions par hota hai.

Graham yeh bhi wazeh karte hain ke inflation koi nayi cheez nahi. America ki history mein aise daur aa chuke hain jab inflation bohot tez thi, jaise 1915 se 1920 ke darmiyan jab prices taqreeban double ho gayi thin. Is ke muqable mein 1965 se 1970 ke darmiyan inflation ka rate kaafi moderate tha. Is se lesson yeh milta hai ke inflation aati jaati rehti hai, is liye investor ko na to usey nazarandaz karna chahiye aur na hi us se ghabra kar apni poori strategy badal leni chahiye.

Future inflation ke hawalay se Graham koi extreme forecast nahi dete. Woh kehte hain ke reasonable estimate lagbhag 3% saalana ho sakta hai. Is rate par inflation bond income ka khaasa hissa kha jati hai, lekin agar investor apni spending disciplined rakhe aur poori income kharch na kare, to apni purchasing power ko kaafi had tak maintain kar sakta hai. Is liye bonds ko mukammal tor par reject kar dena aqalmandi nahi.

Stocks ke hawalay se Graham ek aur important ghalat fehmi ko todte hain. Yeh maana jata hai ke inflation companies ki earnings ko automatically barha deti hai, lekin historical data is baat ki tasdeeq nahi karta. American corporations ki return on capital inflation ke bawajood barhi nahi, balkay kai dafa kam ho gayi. Earnings mein jo growth nazar aayi, woh asal mein reinvested profits aur naye capital ki wajah se thi, na ke inflation ki wajah se. Agar inflation waqai companies ke liye faidemand hoti, to purane capital par bhi earnings rate barhna chahiye tha — jo kabhi hua hi nahi.

Is ke ilawa inflation ne companies ke liye naye masail bhi paida kiye. Wages productivity se zyada barhi, naye capital ki zaroorat barhti gayi, aur corporate debt bohot tez raftaar se barha. Nateeja yeh nikla ke interest burden ne companies ki financial strength ko kamzor kar diya. Yani inflation ne companies ko strong banane ke bajaye zyada leveraged aur fragile bana diya.

Graham yeh bhi batate hain ke stock market kabhi seedhi line mein nahi chalta. Earnings aur prices fluctuate karti rehti hain. Inflation ki bunyaad par yeh assume kar lena ke stocks lagataar barhte rahenge, investor ko ghalat waqt par zyada buying par majboor kar sakta hai. Bull market ko agar inflation theory ki tasdeeq samajh liya jaye, to investor bubble ke peak par phans sakta hai, jiska anjaam aksar lambi muddat ki disappointment hota hai.

Chapter ke end par Graham yeh conclusion dete hain ke na to stocks perfect inflation hedge hain aur na hi bonds ko mukammal tor par kharab samajhna chahiye. A defensive aur intelligent investor ke liye sab se behtar approach balance hai. Kuch hissa bonds mein hona chahiye aur kuch stocks mein, taake na sirf income ka sahara milay balkay inflation ke khilaf bhi kuch had tak protection rahe. Extreme soch aur speculation se door rehna hi is chapter ka bunyadi lesson hai.

## **Summary in English**

In Chapter 2 of *The Intelligent Investor*, Benjamin Graham examines inflation and the widespread misconceptions it creates among investors. When purchasing power declines, investors naturally become anxious and begin reshaping their strategies around inflation fears. Graham emphasizes that while inflation should not be ignored, reacting emotionally or making extreme investment decisions because of it is even more dangerous.

It is commonly believed that inflation is devastating for bonds because their income and principal are fixed, while stocks are assumed to benefit since companies can raise prices and increase earnings. This belief has led many to conclude that bonds are always bad investments and stocks are always superior. Graham firmly rejects this logic. No investment is permanently good or bad; its attractiveness depends on price, valuation, and prevailing conditions.

Graham also reminds readers that inflation is not a modern phenomenon. Severe inflation occurred between 1915 and 1920, while other periods experienced falling prices. The lesson is that inflation comes and goes, and investors must be prepared for it without allowing it to dominate their thinking or dictate extreme actions.

When estimating future inflation, Graham avoids dramatic forecasts. A reasonable assumption, he suggests, is about 3% annually. At this level, inflation does erode bond income, but a disciplined investor who does not consume all interest income can still preserve purchasing power. Therefore, dismissing bonds entirely is unjustified.

One of the most important arguments in the chapter is Graham’s challenge to the idea that inflation automatically increases corporate earnings. Historical evidence shows that the return on capital of American corporations has not risen with inflation and has often declined. Growth in earnings primarily resulted from reinvested profits and additional capital, not from inflation itself. If inflation were truly beneficial, it would have increased returns on existing capital, which did not occur.

Moreover, inflation introduced significant negative pressures on corporations. Wages rose faster than productivity, capital requirements increased, and corporate debt expanded far more rapidly than profits. Rising interest rates turned this debt into a serious financial burden, weakening corporate balance sheets rather than strengthening them.

Graham further cautions that stock prices and earnings do not grow smoothly. Markets fluctuate. Investors who interpret rising stock prices during inflation as confirmation of a permanent trend may be tempted to buy aggressively at high levels, only to suffer when the cycle reverses. Inflation-based optimism can therefore lead to poor timing and long-term disappointment.

The chapter concludes with a clear message: stocks are not guaranteed inflation hedges, and bonds are not inherently inferior investments. The intelligent investor adopts a balanced approach, combining bonds and stocks to manage both income needs and inflation risk. Avoiding extremes, speculation, and emotional reactions is the true lesson of *The Investor and Inflation*.
