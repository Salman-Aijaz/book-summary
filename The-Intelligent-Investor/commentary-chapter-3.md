# **Bull-Market Baloney (The Intelligent Investor)**

---

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Is topic mein Benjamin Graham yeh batate hain ke intelligent investor kabhi bhi future ka andaza sirf past returns ko dekh kar nahi lagata. History ko blindly extrapolate karna sab se bari ghalti hoti hai. 1990s mein bohat se market “gurus” ne yahi ghalti ki—unhon ne kaha ke kyun ke stocks hamesha long term mein acha return dete aaye hain, is liye future mein bhi wohi hoga.

Logon ne yeh bhi maanna shuru kar diya ke stocks bonds ya cash se kam risky hain, bas agar unhein kaafi arsey tak hold kiya jaye. Is soch ne logon ko mehngi prices par stocks khareedne par majboor kar diya. Graham ne is attitude ko “heedlessness” kaha aur sawal uthaya ke kya aisi laaparwahi bina saza ke reh sakti hai? History ne proof kar diya ke jawab **no** hai.

2000 ke baad market crash ne sab bullish claims ko jhoota sabit kar diya. Jo stocks “sure winners” lag rahe thay, unhon ne 70%, 80% hatta ke 99% tak value kho di. Is topic ka core lesson yeh hai ke market ka jazbati mahaul, expert opinions aur past performance par andha bharosa investor ko tabah kar sakta hai. Har dafa market apni had se aagay jaye, correction lazmi hoti hai.

## **Summary in English**

In this topic, Graham exposes the danger of blindly projecting the future based on past market performance. He warns that intelligent investors must never assume that historical returns will automatically repeat themselves. During the bull market of the 1990s, many experts argued that stocks had always delivered strong long-term returns, so they must continue to do so indefinitely.

Some even claimed that stocks were safer than bonds or cash if held long enough, which led investors to ignore valuation entirely. Graham strongly rejected this mindset, calling it reckless complacency. He believed that when investors become careless and overconfident, the market eventually punishes them.

The market collapse of 2000–2002 proved Graham right. Popular “can’t-miss” stocks lost massive value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. This topic reinforces Graham’s timeless lesson: high prices always mean higher risk, regardless of how optimistic the market feels. Intelligent investing requires discipline, valuation awareness, and emotional control—not blind faith in the past.

# **SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST**

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Is argument mein aik bohat bari khami thi ke stocks hamesha long run mein bonds se behtar perform karte hain. Masla yeh hai ke 1871 se pehle ka reliable data maujood hi nahi. Jo early stock indexes use kiye gaye, un mein sirf **7 companies** shamil theen, jab ke asal America mein us waqt **300 se zyada companies** maujood theen—jin mein se aksar bankrupt ho gayeen aur investors ka paisa doob gaya.

Indexes ne sirf un companies ko include kiya jo survive kar gayeen aur jo fail ho gayeen unhein ignore kar diya. Isko **survivorship bias** kehte hain. Is wajah se history ka record reality se zyada acha dikhaya gaya. Real investors ko yeh pata hi nahi hota tha ke kaun si 7 companies survive karein gi.

Haan, kuch rare companies jaise Bank of New York aur JP Morgan Chase 1790s se chal rahi hain, lekin un ke muqable mein hazaaron companies tabah ho gayeen—jin ka naam history se hi gaib kar diya gaya. Is liye jo log kehte hain ke long-term record prove karta hai ke stocks guaranteed bonds aur cash se behtar hotay hain, woh asal mein data ko ghalat samajh rahe hote hain.

---

## **Summary in English**

The claim that stocks have “always” beaten bonds in the long run contains a fatal flaw: reliable data before 1871 simply does not exist. Early stock market indexes were based on as few as seven companies, while hundreds of real businesses operated at the time—most of which went bankrupt, wiping out investors’ capital.

These failed companies were excluded from historical indexes, creating what is known as **survivorship bias**. As a result, historical stock returns appear far better than what real investors actually experienced. Only a small number of companies survived continuously, while thousands of failures were erased from the data.

Later research suggests that early stock returns were overstated by at least two percentage points per year. In reality, stocks performed no better—and possibly worse—than bonds or cash during that period. Therefore, anyone claiming that history “proves” stocks are guaranteed to outperform bonds or cash is fundamentally misunderstanding the data.

# **THE HIGHER THEY GO, THE HARDER THEY FALL**

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Graham bull-market ki overconfidence ka aik simple ilaaj batate hain: **sawal uthao**. Woh kehte hain ke yeh maanna ke stocks future mein bhi hamesha wahi returns dein ge jo past mein dete aaye hain, aik dangerous ghalat fehmi hai. Agar har investor yeh maan le ke stocks long run mein guaranteed paisa banate hain, to phir market naturally **overpriced** ho jati hai. Aur jab price bohat zyada ho jaye, to future returns high kaise reh sakte hain?

Graham ka logic simple hai: **har investment ki value us price se tied hoti hai jo aap us ke liye pay karte ho**. 1990s ke end mein inflation kam thi, profits barh rahe thay, aur duniya relatively peaceful thi—but iska matlab yeh nahi ke stocks kisi bhi price par khareedna sahi tha. Companies ke profits limited hote hain, is liye unki valuation bhi limited honi chahiye.

Example ke taur par, Michael Jordan aik legendary basketball player tha. Chicago Bulls ne usey million dollars de kar ek acha deal kiya. Lekin iska matlab yeh nahi ke woh usay **har price par** khareed sakte thay. Talent ho ya business—**price agar zyada ho to best cheez bhi bad investment ban jati hai**. Yehi investing ka psychology lesson hai.

---

## **Summary in English**

As a cure for bull-market overconfidence, Graham urges investors to ask simple but skeptical questions. Why should future stock returns always match past returns? If everyone believes stocks are guaranteed winners, won’t the market become dangerously overpriced? And once prices rise too high, how can future returns remain attractive?

Graham’s answer is grounded in logic: **the value of any investment depends on the price you pay for it**. In the late 1990s, inflation was low, corporate profits were strong, and global conditions looked stable—but that never meant stocks were worth buying at any price. Since corporate profits are finite, stock prices must also have limits.

The Michael Jordan example makes this clear. He may have been the greatest basketball player ever, and the Bulls benefited by paying him millions. But that doesn’t mean he would have been worth **any** price. In investing, even the best asset becomes a bad investment if the price is too high. This is the core psychological lesson Graham wanted investors to understand.

# **When Recent Returns Fool Investors**

---

## **Roman Urdu Explanation**

Graham warn karte hain ke jab market ke **recent returns bohat achay** lag rahe hon, to log aik **bohat ghalat aur dangerous conclusion** nikaal lete hain:
ke future mein bhi stocks hamesha isi tarah shandaar results denge.

1995 se 1999 ke darmiyan market har saal **20% ya us se zyada** grow hui — jo American history mein pehli dafa hua. Is continuous rise ne investors ko aur zyada optimistic bana diya.

* 1998 ke mid mein Gallup survey ke mutabiq investors ko lagta tha ke aglay saal unka portfolio **13% return** dega.
* Sirf do saal baad, early 2000 mein, yeh expectation **18% se zyada** ho gayi.

Sirf aam investors hi nahi, balkay **“sophisticated professionals”** bhi isi optimism ka shikaar ho gaye.
2001 mein SBC Communications ne apne pension plan ka expected return **8.5% se 9.5%** kar diya.
2002 tak, S&P 500 companies ke pension plans ka average assumed return **9.2%** ho gaya — jo record high tha.

Phir reality ne hit kiya.

* 2001–2002 mein investor expectations gir kar **7%** reh gayin,
  halanke stocks **2000 ke mukable mein 50% saste** ho chuke thay.
* Overconfidence ki wajah se S&P 500 companies ko **kam az kam $32 billion ka nuksan** uthana pada.

Graham yahan aik simple baat samjhate hain:
log theory mein kehte hain *“buy low, sell high”*, lekin practice mein aksar **ulta** karte hain —
jab prices upar hoti hain tab buy, aur jab girti hain tab panic sell.

**Rule of opposites** ke mutabiq:

* jitni zyada long-term enthusiasm hoti hai,
* utni hi zyada short-term ghalti ka chance hota hai.

March 24, 2000 ko U.S. stock market ki total value **$14.75 trillion** thi.
Sirf 30 months baad, October 9, 2002 ko yeh gir kar **$7.34 trillion** reh gayi —
yaani **50% se zyada ka nuksan**.

Is ke baad wohi experts jo pehle bohat bullish thay, ab extreme bearish predictions dene lagay — ke market saalon tak kuch nahi karegi.

Isi point par Graham aik seedha sawal uthate hain:
jab “experts” pichli dafa itni buri tarah ghalat sabit ho chuke hain,
to **intelligent investor un par dobara kyun yaqeen kare?**

---

## **English Explanation**

Graham warns that focusing on recent strong market returns leads investors to a dangerous illusion: believing that stocks will continue producing the same outstanding results in the future.

From 1995 to 1999, the market rose by **20% or more every year**, an unprecedented run. This consistent rise made investors increasingly optimistic.

* In mid-1998, a Gallup survey showed investors expected about **13% returns** over the next year.
* By early 2000, expected returns had climbed to **over 18%**.

Even so-called **sophisticated professionals** joined the optimism.
In 2001, SBC Communications raised its pension return assumption from **8.5% to 9.5%**.
By 2002, the average assumed return of S&P 500 pension plans reached a **record 9.2%**.

Then reality struck.

* In 2001–2002, expected one-year returns collapsed to **7%**,
  even though stock prices were nearly **50% lower** than in 2000.
* Over-optimistic pension assumptions ended up costing S&P 500 companies
  **at least $32 billion**.

Although investors know they should *buy low and sell high*, in practice they often do the opposite.
Graham’s warning is simple: **by the rule of opposites**, the more enthusiastic investors become about long-term stock returns, the more likely they are to be wrong in the short run.

On March 24, 2000, the total U.S. stock market was worth **$14.75 trillion**.
By October 9, 2002—just 30 months later—it had fallen to **$7.34 trillion**, a loss of over **50%**.

After the crash, the same experts who were once wildly bullish turned deeply bearish.
Graham’s final question cuts through the noise:
If experts were disastrously wrong the last time they all agreed, why should the intelligent investor believe them now?

# **Thinking About Future Returns (Graham Style)**

---

## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Aik intelligent investor ko market ke shor-sharabe se door rehna chahiye aur future returns ko logically sochna chahiye, jaise Graham sochte. Stock market ka performance **teen cheezon** par depend karta hai:

1. **Real growth** – companies ke earnings aur dividends ka barhna
2. **Inflationary growth** – economy mein aam cheezon ki qeemat ka barhna
3. **Speculative growth/decline** – investors ka stock kharidne ka shauq ya dar

Long run mein, corporate earnings per share ka yearly growth lagbhag **1.5% se 2%** hota hai (inflation ke ilawa). 2003 ke shuru mein, annual inflation **2.4%** thi, aur dividend yield **1.9%** thi. Toh simple math yeh hua:

```
1.5% – 2% (real growth)
+ 2.4% (inflation)
+ 1.9% (dividends)
= 5.8% – 6.3% expected return
```

Is ka matlab hai ke long run mein stocks ka average return **6% ya 4% after inflation** reasonable hai. Agar investing public phir se zyada greedy ho jaye, toh speculative fever temporarily returns ko upar le ja sakta hai. Agar dar zyada ho, jaise 1930s aur 1970s mein, returns temporarily gir jaate hain.

Robert Shiller, Yale University ke finance professor, Graham se inspired hain. Unka approach yeh hai ke woh S&P 500 index ki **current price** ko **last 10 saalon ke average corporate profits (after inflation)** ke saath compare karte hain. Historical record se pata chalta hai: jab Shiller ratio **20 se upar** hota hai, market usually poor returns deta hai; aur jab **10 se neeche** hota hai, stocks kaafi achi returns dete hain.

Early 2003 mein Shiller ke hisaab se stocks ka ratio **22.8** tha — abhi bhi danger zone, lekin December 1999 ke **44.2** se kaafi neeche. Pichle periods mein, jab market is level par tha, returns mix rahe: kabhi acha, kabhi bura, aur kabhi average. Graham conservative approach se mid-point consider karte aur project karte ke **next decade mein stocks roughly 6% annually, ya 4% after inflation** kamaenge. Ye estimate match karta hai unke pehle wale calculation se (real + inflation + speculative growth).

Compared to 1990s, 6% low hai, lekin ye bonds se thoda better hai. Diversified portfolio ke liye yeh kaafi reason hai stocks hold karne ka.

Second lesson ye hai ke future ko forecast karte waqt **aap probably wrong ho jayenge**. Past ka ek indisputable lesson ye hai ke **future hamesha surprise karega**, aur sab se zyada wo log surprise honge jo apni predictions ke bohot confident hain. Graham ki tarah **humble rehna** aapko risk ko control karne mein madad karega.

Iska matlab ye nahi ke spirit low ho jaye. Intelligent investor ke liye **hope hamesha rehti hai**. Market mein, jitna future dark lagta hai, waisa hi often better outcome milta hai. Jaise G.K. Chesterton ne kaha:

> “Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy everything.”

## **Summary in English**

An intelligent investor should tune out the noise and think about future returns logically, just as Graham did. The stock market’s performance depends on **three factors**:

1. **Real growth** – the rise in companies’ earnings and dividends
2. **Inflationary growth** – the general increase in prices across the economy
3. **Speculative growth/decline** – the investing public’s appetite for stocks

In the long run, corporate earnings per share have grown roughly **1.5% to 2% annually** (excluding inflation). By early 2003, inflation was around **2.4%**, and the dividend yield was **1.9%**, giving a simple expected return of:

```
1.5% – 2% (real growth)
+ 2.4% (inflation)
+ 1.9% (dividends)
= 5.8% – 6.3%
```

This suggests that **long-term stock returns of roughly 6% (or 4% after inflation)** are reasonable. Speculative excitement can temporarily push returns higher, while fear can drag them lower, as seen in the 1930s and 1970s.

Robert Shiller, a Yale finance professor, was inspired by Graham. He compares the **current S&P 500 price** to **average inflation-adjusted profits over the past 10 years**. Historically, when this ratio exceeds **20**, future returns are usually poor; below **10**, returns are typically strong.

In early 2003, the ratio was **22.8**, still in the danger zone but much lower than the December 1999 level of **44.2**. Historical data show mixed results from similar levels—sometimes good, sometimes poor. Graham would likely take a **conservative midpoint**, projecting **roughly 6% annual returns (4% after inflation)** over the next decade, which aligns with the sum of real growth, inflation, and speculative growth.

Compared to the 1990s, 6% seems modest, but it’s slightly better than bonds and sufficient reason for investors to hold stocks in a diversified portfolio.

The second key lesson is that **forecasting future returns is inherently uncertain**. History teaches that the **future always surprises**, especially those most confident in their predictions. Staying humble, as Graham did, helps limit risk.

This does not mean losing hope. For the intelligent investor, **hope always remains**. In financial markets, the darker the outlook, the better the eventual outcome often turns out. As G.K. Chesterton said:

> “Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy everything.”
