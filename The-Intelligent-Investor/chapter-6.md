## **Summary in Roman Urdu**

Aggressive investor ka matlab yeh nahi hota ke wo bina soche samjhe risk le. Benjamin Graham ke mutabiq aggressive investor ko bhi defensive investor ki tarah hi start karna chahiye, yani apna paisa achi quality ke bonds aur strong companies ke stocks mein lagana chahiye. Farq sirf itna hota hai ke aggressive investor thora zyada risk le sakta hai, lekin har extra risk ke peeche uska proper logic hona zaroori hai.

Second-grade bonds aur preferred stocks aksar is liye khareeday jate hain kyun ke unka interest zyada hota hai. Lekin sirf zyada return dekh kar inhein khareedna ghalat hota hai. History yeh dikhati hai ke jab market girti hai, to yeh bonds bohot tez girti hain aur kabhi kabhi investor apna asal paisa bhi kho deta hai. Sirf 1 ya 2 percent extra income ke liye apna capital risk mein daalna aqalmandi nahi hoti. Agar koi aisi security full price par mil rahi ho to usay avoid karna chahiye, kyun ke aksar ye cheezen baad mein bohot sasti ho jati hain.

Foreign government bonds ka record bhi zyada acha nahi raha. Agar kisi foreign mulk ki economy ya politics bigar jaye to investor ke paas apna paisa wapas lene ka koi strong tareeqa nahi hota. History mein bohot se examples hain jahan logon ne zyada yield ke lalach mein foreign bonds khareeday aur baad mein unki value lagbhag khatam ho gayi. Is liye aam investors ke liye foreign bonds se door rehna behtar hota hai.

New issues, jaise naye bonds ya IPOs, zyada tar bull market ke dauran launch hote hain. Is waqt market ka mood positive hota hai aur companies apni securities mehngi prices par bechti hain. Strong marketing aur sales pressure investor ko attract karta hai, lekin aksar in companies ka long-term record weak hota hai. Jab market ka josh khatam hota hai, to yeh new issues bohot buri tarah gir jate hain aur investor ko heavy loss ho jata hai.

Is poori discussion ka simple lesson yeh hai ke aggressive investor ko bhi sirf zyada return ke lalach mein andha risk nahi lena chahiye. Risk tab lena chahiye jab potential profit bohot zyada ho aur security sasti price par mil rahi ho. Sabar aur discipline ke saath invest karna hi lambi race jeetne ka tareeqa hai.

## **Summary in English**

An aggressive investor does not mean a reckless investor. According to Benjamin Graham, an aggressive investor should begin in the same way as a defensive investor, by investing in high-quality bonds and strong common stocks. The only difference is that an aggressive investor may take additional risks, but every such decision must have a clear and logical justification.

Second-grade bonds and preferred stocks often attract investors because they offer higher interest. However, buying them only for extra yield is a mistake. History shows that these securities fall sharply during bad markets, sometimes causing serious losses to the investor’s principal. Risking your capital just to earn one or two percent more income is not sensible. If such securities are selling at full price, it is usually better to stay away and wait for much lower prices.

Foreign government bonds have also performed poorly over time. When political or economic trouble arises, investors have very little protection and no effective way to recover their money. Many investors in the past were tempted by higher yields and later suffered heavy losses. For this reason, foreign bonds are generally unsuitable for ordinary investors.

New issues, including new bonds and IPOs, usually appear during bull markets. At such times, market optimism allows companies to sell securities at attractive prices for themselves but unfavorable ones for buyers. Strong marketing often hides weak fundamentals. When market conditions change, many of these new issues collapse, leading to large losses for investors.

The main lesson is simple. Even an aggressive investor should not take blind risks for slightly higher returns. Risk should be taken only when the potential reward is significant and the price offers a clear margin of safety. Patience and discipline remain the most reliable tools for long-term investing success.
