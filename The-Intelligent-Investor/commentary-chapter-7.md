# **COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 7**

It requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution to make a great fortune; and when you have got it, it requires ten times as much wit to keep it.
                                            —Nathan Mayer Rothschild

## **TIMING IS NOTHING**

### **Short Summary (Roman Urdu)**

Is hissa ka central message yeh hai ke **market timing aik ghalat khayal hai**. Theory mein lagta hai ke agar investor sahi waqt par stocks khareeday aur mehngay honay par bech de to bohat zyada paisa bana sakta hai. Lekin asal masla yeh hai ke **kisi ko pehle se yeh nahi pata hota ke sab se bure din kaun se honge**. Yeh baat sirf hindsight mein clear hoti hai.

Is ki misaal **Alan Greenspan** ki di gayi hai, jo apne waqt ka bohat bara financial expert tha, lekin phir bhi market ko ghalat samjha. Isi tarah professional market timers aur newsletters bhi aksar market ko beat nahi kar pate. Research dikhati hai ke **simple index fund mein invested rehna**, market timing se zyada behtar results deta hai.

Jaise **Søren Kierkegaard** ne kaha: zindagi ko peeche dekh kar samjha ja sakta hai, lekin jeena hamesha aagay hota hai. Market mein bhi baad mein sab kuch obvious lagta hai, lekin real time mein future andha hota hai. Isi liye aam investor ke liye market timing **na practical hai aur na emotionally possible**.

---

### **Short Summary (English)**

This section explains why **market timing does not work in real life**. While it may seem logical to buy stocks when they are cheap and sell when they are expensive, the problem is that **no one can know in advance which days will be the worst or the best**. Such clarity only exists in hindsight.

The text highlights that even top experts like **Alan Greenspan** made confident predictions that turned out to be completely wrong. Studies also show that professional market timers and newsletters generally **underperform simple stock index funds** over time.

As **Søren Kierkegaard** observed, life can only be understood backward but must be lived forward. In investing, hindsight is always clear, but foresight is unreliable. Therefore, for most investors, **market timing is both practically impossible and emotionally exhausting**, making long-term disciplined investing the smarter choice.

## 📌 **English Summary**

## **HIGH POTENTIAL FOR HYPE POTENTIAL**

### 📌 **English Summary**

This passage shows that **even top executives can believe the illusion that hyper-growth will last forever**. In 2000, leaders at **Nortel Networks** and **Cisco Systems** confidently predicted extremely high growth, despite their stocks already trading at dangerously high valuations. Executives like **John Roth** and **John Chambers** encouraged investors to buy, believing growth would continue. Instead, both companies suffered sharp revenue declines, massive losses, and catastrophic stock crashes. The lesson is clear: **when growth expectations become unrealistic, overpriced stocks eventually collapse**, no matter how confident management sounds.

## **SHOULD YOU PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET?**

### 📌 **English Summary**

Figures like **Andrew Carnegie** believed success comes from putting everything into one investment, and history shows that many fortunes—such as **Bill Gates** with **Microsoft**, **Sam Walton** with **Walmart**, and the **Rockefeller family** with **Standard Oil**—were built this way. However, data from the **Forbes 400** shows that most concentrated fortunes did **not survive long-term**. Only 16% of the 1982 list remained by 2002. The lesson is clear: **concentration may build wealth, but diversification is essential to protect it**.

---

## **THE BARGAIN BIN**

### 📌 **English Summary**

This passage explains how finding **Graham-style bargain stocks** still requires careful research despite the Internet. Investors can use resources like **Wall Street Journal**, NYSE/NASDAQ Scorecards, and company financial reports to identify stocks trading **below their net working capital (“net nets”)**. An example is **Comverse Technology** in 2002, whose stock price was roughly equal to its net assets, meaning the ongoing business was almost free. However, Graham warns that **risk still exists**, so investors should buy **a diversified set of such bargains** and hold them patiently to increase the likelihood of profit.

Misal ke taur par, 2002 mein **Comverse Technology** ka stock price uske net assets ke barabar tha—yaani business virtually free tha. Lekin Graham ka kehna hai ke **risk ab bhi hai**, is liye aise stocks mein **diversified investment** karke patience se hold karna chahiye taake profit ka chance barh jaye.


## **WHAT’S YOUR FOREIGN POLICY?**

### 📌 **English Summary**

This passage explains the importance of **geographical diversification**. Even if your home market is doing extremely well—as Japan did in 1989—putting all your money in local stocks can be risky. Over the next decade, Japanese investors who ignored foreign markets lost about **two-thirds of their money**. Graham’s advice: investors should allocate a portion of their portfolio, up to **one-third**, to **foreign stocks or mutual funds**, because no one can predict which country will perform best in the future. Diversifying internationally helps protect against unexpected domestic downturns.

---

### 📌 **Roman Urdu Summary**

Yeh hissa **geographical diversification** ki importance samjhata hai. Chahe aapka home market kitna bhi strong ho—jaise Japan 1989 mein tha—sara paisa local stocks mein lagana risky ho sakta hai. Agle 10 saalon mein un Japanese investors ne jo foreign markets ignore kiye, lagbhag **do-thirds paisa khoya**. Graham ka mashwara: portfolio ka kuch hissa, **taqreeban ek-third**, **foreign stocks ya mutual funds** mein lagayein, kyunki koi predict nahi kar sakta ke future mein kaunsa mulk best perform karega. International diversification aapko unexpected domestic losses se bachata hai.
